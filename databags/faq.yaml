    question: What happens if a ticket was purchased before receiving a free speaker ticket?
    answer: |
      Ticket purchases will be refunded up to **27 March 2026**.
      If a talk is accepted after that date, a refund will still be issued accordingly.
      Alternatively, the purchased ticket can be transferred to a colleague before the conference.

    question: I have updated some information, but it does not appear on the website. Why?
    answer: |
      The conference website is static and regularly synchronized with data from Pretalx.  
      Updates may take some time to appear, so a short delay is normal.  
    
      Please note that all information updates must be made directly through Pretalx.  
      Requests sent by email or to the helpdesk cannot be processed.

    question: Will internet access be available during my talk?
    answer: |
      Internet access during talks is **not guaranteed**.  
      Presentations should not rely on a stable internet connection.  
  
      While efforts are made to ensure good WiFi coverage, performance may vary and cannot be guaranteed.  
      Use of the conference network is at the speaker’s own risk.
