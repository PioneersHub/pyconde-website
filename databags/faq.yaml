    question: Will internet access be available during my talk?
    answer: >
      Internet access during talks is **not guaranteed**.  
      Presentations should not rely on a stable internet connection.  
  
      While efforts are made to ensure good WiFi coverage, performance may vary and cannot be guaranteed.  
      Use of the conference network is at the speaker‚Äôs own risk.
