title: "We Get Things Done: Together"

body: >
  Built by the community, for the community.

  PyCon DE & PyData is organized by volunteers—experts, developers, data scientists, and AI engineers and thoughtful executives who are shaping the field — who give their time because they believe in open knowledge sharing and an inclusive, diverse community.

  We foster a respectful, collaborative culture where people connect across roles, backgrounds, and experience levels—learning with and from each other.

  Every talk is selected by peers who know the field—so you get real insights, honest lessons learned, and practical takeaways beyond the slide hype.
  Every decision puts your experience over profit.

  That’s why the program is this strong.
