title: "We Get Things Done: Together"

body: >
  Built by the community, for the community.
  PyCon DE & PyData is organized entirely by volunteers —
  developers, data scientists, and engineers who give their time
  because they believe in open knowledge sharing.
  Every talk is selected by peers who understand the field.
  Every decision prioritizes your experience over profit.
  That's why the quality is this high.
