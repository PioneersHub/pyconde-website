title: "We Get Things Done: Together"

body: >
  Built by the community, for the community.

  PyCon DE & PyData is organized entirely by volunteers—experts, developers, data scientists, AI engineers, and thoughtful executives shaping the field—who give their time because they believe in open knowledge sharing and an inclusive, diverse community.

  This isn’t just a great program. It’s a meeting point for deep experience and real thought leadership—where hard-won lessons, bold ideas, and emerging practices get shared early, tested in conversation, and turned into what comes next.

  Every talk is selected by peers who know the field—so you get real insights, honest lessons learned, and practical takeaways beyond the slide hype.
  Every decision puts your experience over profit.

  That’s why the impact goes far beyond the stage—and why the quality stays this high.
