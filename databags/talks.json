            "abstract": "Traditional API architectures face significant challenges in environments where repetitive and frequent requests are required to retrieve data updates. These request-response mechanisms introduce latency, as clients must continually query the server to check for changes, often receiving redundant or outdated information. This approach leads to increased network overhead, inefficient use of server resources and diminished scalability as the number of clients or requests grows. Additionally, frequent requests expand the attack surface, requiring security measures to mitigate risks such as (un-)authorised access, rate limiting and query sanitisation. Managing all of these inherent problem results in increasingly complex systems to maintain and improve while putting considerable implementation effort onto the customer.\r\nJoin to find out how transitioning to a streaming architecture can address these issues by providing proactive, event-based data delivery, reducing latency, minimising redundant processing, enhancing scalability and simplifying security management.",
            "description": "In this talk we will go over which benefits, drawbacks and lessons Airbus has encountered/learned in the switch from an API to a Python based Stream Architecture for continuous flight traffic prediction. The Goal is to highlight Stream based architectures as a architectural alternative and allow the attendees to decide if it could be a alternative to their current API based Setup worthwhile to look into.\r\n\r\nThe talk addresses the inefficiencies and limitations of traditional API-based architectures for real-time data delivery. Specifically, it explores challenges such as high latency, network overhead, customer effort, and scalability issues when APIs rely on polling mechanisms. These issues became apparent at Airbus during a project as customer needs evolved, highlighting the shortcomings of APIs in handling real-time updates effectively. This story of the project will aid as an example on how to identify a limiting architectural decision and what pain points can potentially be avoided by taking a new route guiding us along the talk.\r\n\r\nFor developers and architects building modern, data-driven applications, choosing the right architecture is critical. Many face similar challenges when scaling APIs for real-time use cases, such as IoT, financial data, or notifications. This problem is relevant because adopting an unsuitable architecture can lead to poor performance, higher costs, and frustrated users.\r\n\r\nThe proposed solution is to transition from an API-based architecture to a streaming architecture for real-time data delivery. This involves leveraging stream processing systems that push updates proactively, handle high-throughput data efficiently, and offer features like backpressure, partitioning, and stateful processing. Recent developments in Python based tools such as **Bytewax**, **Faust** and **Quix** are highlighted for their scalability and fault-tolerance capabilities.\r\n\r\n### Key Takeaways\r\n1. **Challenges of APIs**: Polling APIs is inefficient for real-time updates, leading to delays, resource wastage, and customer dissatisfaction.\r\n2. **Advantages of Streaming**: Streaming architectures offer real-time data delivery, lower latency, reduced customer effort, better scalability, and improved fault tolerance.\r\n3. **Key Streaming Concepts**: Understanding backpressure, partitioning, and stateful processing is essential for understanding streaming specific limitations and solutions.\r\n4. **Architectural Considerations**: Streaming is ideal for use cases where data changes frequently and needs to be delivered in real time, while APIs may still be suitable for low-frequency, static, or manual queries.\r\n5. **Strategic Transition**: Adopting a streaming approach requires a paradigm shift in thinking about how data is delivered and processed, with significant changes to the system architecture which needs to be cautiously managed.",

            "description": "Fast and reliable tests are the backbone of maintaining quality and performance in data-heavy applications, where even small issues can cascade into significant bottlenecks or failures. A streamlined testing process allows developers to confidently evolve complex systems while ensuring robustness and efficiency.\r\n\r\nFor integration and system tests in data-driven applications, the setup and teardown of data layers (e.g., databases, blob storage) often take more time than the actual test execution. A common approach is to use session-scoped test resources, but this introduces shared dependencies that couple tests together. As a result, developers must carefully manage resource cleanup after each test to prevent interference, leading to tests that are often flaky, verbose, and harder to maintain.\r\n\r\nThis talk will demonstrate how to leverage pytest fixtures to abstract setup and teardown logic across both session and function scopes. This method ensures proper resource cleanup, improves test isolation, and enhances test readability and development efficiency. We\u2019ll also explore strategies for parallelizing test execution while sharing system resources effectively, enabling faster and more scalable testing.\r\n\r\nThis talk is designed for intermediate to advanced Python developers with a strong interest in testing and improving their development workflows.",

We'll look at a before-and-after example to see how these changes can make your app easier to use and debug. Plus, we'll discuss when Django's simplicity is enough and when it's worth adopting a more structured approach. You'll leave with practical tips for transforming your Django projects into systems that can handle increased complexity.",
            "description": "Django's model-view-serializer framework is a powerful tool for building small to medium-sized applications quickly and efficiently. Its straightforward approach allows developers to create CRUD operations with minimal effort, making it an excellent choice for projects with clear and simple requirements. However, as applications grow in complexity and scale, developers often encounter several challenges that can hinder the application's maintainability and scalability.\r\nOne common issue is the scattering of database operations across the codebase. This pattern often leads to tightly coupled APIs and database models, making it difficult to isolate logic for individual testing and increasing the fragility of the application as it scales. As database logic becomes intertwined with business logic, maintaining and expanding the application becomes increasingly challenging.\r\nIn this talk, we will explore these common pitfalls through real-world examples and demonstrate how to refactor a Django application for improved scalability and maintainability. Using a webhook server app as a case study, we'll discuss how client-driven response customization can complicate the traditional model-view-serializer approach. We'll explore the limitations of handling complex serialization and response formatting within the view layer, which often results in bloated views that are hard to test and scale.\r\nTo address these challenges, we'll introduce concepts from Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and hexagonal architecture. By applying these principles, we can decouple the application's components, making it easier to manage and extend. We'll refactor the application using a builder pattern for payload formatting, ensuring that response structures are flexible yet maintainable. Additionally, we'll introduce an injected service layer and a repository layer, which separate concerns and allow for more targeted unit testing. This architecture not only improves testability but also enhances the application's ability to adapt to changing requirements.\r\nWe'll provide a clear before-and-after comparison, highlighting the benefits of this refactored approach. Attendees will learn how these changes can lead to cleaner, more scalable code that is easier to debug and maintain. We'll also discuss the balance between Django's simplicity and the need for more sophisticated architecture, helping developers decide when it's appropriate to adopt these patterns.\r\nBy the end of this session, attendees will gain practical insights into transforming their Django projects into robust systems capable of handling increased complexity. Whether you're a developer working on scaling an existing application or someone interested in learning more about advanced architectural patterns, this talk will provide valuable takeaways and actionable strategies for improving your Django applications.",

By integrating libraries like NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib, PyPLUTO facilitates the visualization of numerical outputs, showcasing how Python effectively enhances scientific understanding and communication.",
            "description": "Numerical simulations have become essential for tackling complex astrophysical problems in recent years. The MagnetoHydroDynamics (MHD) framework plays a central role in studying the dynamic evolution of astrophysical plasmas, governed by partial differential equations that conserve mass, momentum, and energy while incorporating Maxwell's equations for electromagnetic field evolution. Due to the high nonlinearity of the MHD equations (regardless of their specifications, e.g., classical/relativistic or ideal/resistive), a general analytical solution is precluded, making the numerical approach crucial. Numerical simulations usually end up producing large sets of data files and their scientific analysis leans on dedicated software designed for data visualization. However, in order to encompass all of the code output features, specialized tools focusing on the numerical code may represent a more versatile and built-in tool. Here, we present PyPLUTO, a Python package tailored for efficient loading, manipulation, and visualization of outputs produced with the PLUTO code. PyPLUTO uses memory mapping to optimize data loading and provides general routines for data manipulation and visualization. Additionally, it supports the particle modules of the PLUTO code, enabling visualization of particles such as cosmic rays, Lagrangian particles, or dust in hybrid simulations. A user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) further enhances accessibility, allowing for the creation of single-subplot figures with ease. PyPLUTO provides a comprehensive, versatile toolkit for astrophysical data exploration and interpretation.",

In climate and earth system modelling, where datasets often span terabytes, efficient data standardization is critical. This is where\u00a0[`pymorize`](https://github.com/esm-tools/pymorize)\u00a0comes in\u2014a lightweight, open-source framework designed to streamline the standardization of scientific data into the widely-used\u00a0[CMOR (Climate Model Output Rewriter)\u00a0format](https://cmor.llnl.gov).\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will showcase how `pymorize` bridges key PyData libraries, such as\u00a0[`xarray`](https://xarray.dev),\u00a0[`dask`](https://www.dask.org), along with several extensions such as as [`CF-Xarray`](https://cf-xarray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [`pint`](https://pint-xarray.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), and [`uxarray`](https://uxarray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), together with the [Prefect workflow orchestrator](https://www.prefect.io) in order to simplify large-scale data processing pipelines. By leveraging\u00a0SLURM\u00a0for distributed task management and\u00a0Dask\u00a0for parallel computation, Pymorize ensures scalability on both local and high-performance computing environments. We will highlight how this modular system allows researchers to preprocess, validate, and transform data with ease, even under the constraints of limited memory or extreme data sizes.\r\n\r\nKey takeaways will include:\r\n* An overview of how Pymorize integrates tools like Pint and Xarray to handle multidimensional data and unit conversions.\r\n* Practical approaches to parallelizing workflows for CMOR standardization using Dask and SLURM, orchestrated via Prefect.\r\n* Real-world examples of efficiently handling datasets too large to fit in memory, while maintaining reproducibility and transparency.\r\n* Lessons learned from developing scalable workflows in a research-driven environment.\r\n\r\nThis talk is aimed at anyone navigating the complexities of scientific data processing. Whether you\u2019re a researcher, data engineer, or open-source enthusiast, join us to discover how Pymorize turns the PyData ecosystem into a robust solution for large-scale data standardization.\r\n\r\nGitHub: https://github.com/esm-tools/pymorize\r\nDocumentation: https://pymorize.readthedocs.io",

            "description": "Performance optimization remains a critical challenge in Python development. While Python's simplicity and extensive ecosystem make it the language of choice for many applications, its interpreted nature can lead to significant performance bottlenecks. This is particularly evident in data-intensive applications, machine learning pipelines, and large-scale production systems where every millisecond counts.\r\n\r\nMany developers immediately reach for external libraries or complex solutions when facing performance issues. However, Python's standard library and built-in features offer powerful optimization opportunities that are often overlooked. Understanding these fundamental optimization techniques not only improves code performance but also helps developers write more efficient code from the start.\r\n\r\nThis talk addresses the core performance challenges faced by Python developers daily. From memory management to algorithmic efficiency, we'll explore how seemingly simple code changes can lead to substantial performance improvements. Through practical examples drawn from real-world applications, we'll demonstrate how to identify, measure, and optimize performance bottlenecks effectively.",

            "description": "# Description\r\n\r\nOpen Table Formats (OTF) such as Hudi, Iceberg and Delta Lake have disruptively changed the data engineering landscape in recent years. While the Parquet file format has evolved as the de-facto standard for open, interoperable columnar storage for analyical workloads, it lacked first class support for critical features such as ACID compliance, incremental processing, flexible schema & partioning evolution and scalable meta data management. This led to increased development and maintenance efforts while building idempotent and failure tolerant data pipelines that often resulted in custom frameworks. OTFs solve all of these issues via providing a sophisticated meta data layer and improved maintenance capabilities on top of Parquet.\r\n\r\nDriven by the promises of OTFs, we intended to replace our own bronze-read-only Parquet-based storage layer with Delta Lake. In theory, this should have improved performance, reduced maintenanced and provided more flexibility. However, we've stumbled upon several issues:\r\n\r\n1. drastic performance issues with Liquid Clustering during incremental processing\r\n2. inmature interoperability in the python and cloud-based ecosystem (DuckDB, Pandas, Polars, Athena, Snowflake)\r\n3. maintaining logical session-boundaries during incremental processing\r\n\r\nWhile the first two issues are solvable in foreseeable future, the last one is specific to our requirements and does not overlap with design decisions made for incremental processing in Delta Lake. Taken together, these points ultimately led us to go back to relying on Parquet again.\r\n\r\n## Targeted Audience\r\n\r\nThis talk is mainly intended for an intermediate data engineering audience but is well suited for interested beginners, too.

Being result driven I have a passion for facilitating stakeholders to make data driven decisions by quantifying and communicating the impact of interventions to non-specialist audiences in an accessible manner.\r\n\r\nMy claim for fame is that between 2004-2014 I lived in four different continents within a span of a decade, including three tennis Grand Slam cities (NYC, Melbourne, London).",

            "description": "In this session, we will explore how Python can be leveraged to scale diverse Machine Learning (ML) workloads on Kubernetes.\r\n\r\nAt ZEISS, we develop and maintain a computer vision platform that enables users to train ML models across various types, including:\r\n\r\n- 2D and 3D segmentation\r\n- Classification\r\n- Anomaly detection\r\n- Object detection\r\n\r\nOur platform operates entirely on Kubernetes, with each ML workload (training or inference) running in its own Kubernetes pod. Each model type is a distinct, containerized application that implements the same abstract interface. Managing this complexity requires a dedicated orchestrating service capable of initiating ML workloads based on user-selected models and configuration parameters.\r\n\r\n### Workflow Overview\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ll dive into the end-to-end workflow of initiating and managing ML training tasks in Kubernetes:\r\n\r\n1. **User Request**: A user initiates an ML training task by providing a set of parameters.\r\n2. **Task Creation**: The task is transformed into a message and sent to RabbitMQ.\r\n3. **Task Processing**: The orchestrating service (a Celery worker) retrieves the task from RabbitMQ.\r\n4. **Pod Initialization**: The service starts a Kubernetes pod, executing a containerized ML workload based on the task parameters.\r\n5. **Monitoring**: The service continuously tracks workload status and stores updates in a Redis cache.\r\n\r\n### Key Topics and Challenges\r\n\r\nWe will address the following technical complexities:\r\n\r\n- **Celery and RabbitMQ in Kubernetes**: Best practices for setting up and managing these components in a Kubernetes environment.\r\n- **Inter-Service Communication**: Strategies to ensure seamless interaction between ML workload pods and the orchestrating service.\r\n- **Data Access**: How workload pods access the necessary training data securely and efficiently.\r\n- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Configuring the service to create Kubernetes pods while maintaining the principle of least privilege.",

            "notes": "Note that I will not cover the basics of unit testing and pytest so my talk is for a more experienced audience. I will also not cover hypothesis as it was properly discussed in a number of different talks in the past.\r\n\r\nThe main concept we look at during this session is the concept of \"unit\". It is widely misunderstood as being a function or a class. In reality, \"unit\" is most often \"a small piece of a public interface\". If you are making a library, then yes -- your public functions are your public interface. But if you are making an API, a CLI tool, or a GUI, then almost all of your functions are a part of an internal interface, and testing them directly will make it harder for you to refactor.\r\n\r\nBased on this definition of a unit, I then define unit tests as the tests that cover your public interfaces in relatively small pieces to make sure they stay stable and describe the definitional issues for integration vs unit tests. I will then discuss that the real goal of unit testing for me is making your development process faster and more stable, giving you the ability to refactor freely without worrying about breaking things.\r\n\r\nThen we will use these ideas to analyze the most common anti-patterns. The majority of these anti-patterns can be solved or at least minimized by the modern infrastructure. Specifically:\r\n- inline-snapshot allows you to write your tests extremely quickly and assert **a lot** of things while also making it easy to refactor tests afterwards when your asserts need to change\r\n- dirty-equals allows you make your assertions easy to read and write while also giving you the ability to say \"I care that this part of the return has certain properties but I don't really care about the exact value\"\r\n- import-linter gives you the ability to assert the architecture of your application: for example, it allows you to assert that your tests are not importing the private parts of your business logic\r\n- mutmut (mutation testing tool) allows you to test whether your tests are in fact validating your code or whether they are just calling it but won't catch if it breaks. It does so by inserting breaking changes into your code, running your test suite, and then recording whether any tests broke or not -- thousands of times. Many people believe that there is no \"metric\" that you can pair with coverage to validate the quality of your tests. This tool is an amazing counterexample\r\n- pytest-fixture-classes (my library) gives you a chance to write fully typed factory fixtures, eliminating the need to write as many fixtures when most of your tests require a similar fixture but not exactly the same\r\n\r\nThis talk will also mention and explain some of the ideas of matclad and his approach to unit testing:\r\n- https://matklad.github.io/2021/05/31/how-to-test.html\r\n- https://matklad.github.io/2022/07/04/unit-and-integration-tests.html\r\n\r\nHere's the rough outline of my talk:\r\n\r\n```\r\n## Introduction\r\n### How do you define good tests?\r\n### How to define unit vs integration tests and are they actually different\r\n## Let's go through testing issues and how to solve them\r\n### 1. Small units\r\n#### Import-linter to prevent bad imports\r\n### 2. Large units\r\n#### The thinnest possible abstraction layer\r\n### 3. Not enough assertions\r\n#### Mutation testing to the rescue\r\n### 4. Asserting too much\r\n#### Dirty-equals\r\n#### Snapshot testing\r\n### 5. Testing prototypes\r\n#### Only test the things that need to stay the same\r\n### 6. Tests cannot be parallelized\r\n#### Avoid test dependencies\r\n#### Avoid global behavior\r\n#### Apply per-file parallelization\r\n### 7. Tests are hard to write\r\n#### Snapshot testing\r\n#### The thinnest possible abstraction layer\r\n#### Pytest-fixture-classes\r\n### 8. Mocking too much\r\n#### Don't mock your databases\r\n#### Mock **slow** or **hard to setup** external integrations\r\n#### But not always!\r\n```",

Through it, you will learn how to access and load up ONNX models via the Hugging Face Hub. You will also see how to use them to convert multi-modal input (text, images) into embeddings using the ort crate.\r\n\r\nA proposed structure for this talk is:\r\n\r\n- Introducing the ONNX format: Here you will learn about what ONNX models are and why the format is widely accepted in the machine learning industry. You will also briefly see how to generate ONNX models from other models, say PyTorch or TensorFlow.\r\n\r\n- Accessing model weights and model artifacts: Hugging Face has become an incredible enabler of machine learning work in industry and academia. This part of the talk goes into how to download model weights and other essential artifacts from the Hugging Face Hub using the hf_hub crate.\r\n\r\n- Understanding the model artifacts: There are a couple of useful files needed for properly running inference with the downloaded model weights. You will learn about the contents of those files and understand how they help the model yield the best results.\r\n\r\n- Using the ONNX Runtime: In this section, you will learn how to run inference via the ONNX Runtime using the ort crate. This section will cover some of the setup required to load ONNX models and then convert the preprocessed inputs into embeddings.\r\n\r\n- Tying it all together through the lens of a real-world application: Ahnlich-ai is an open-source tool written in Rust and built to aid semantic search. It helps generate embeddings from text, images, and audio inputs using self-hosted models. At its foundation are the core ideas already discussed in the previous sections. Here you will learn how Ahnlich-ai puts together the various ideas to serve the purposes it does today.\r\n\r\nIn the end, you will walk away with knowledge that equips you with the ability to cut down the time it takes to go from input to embeddings for your self-hosted models.

The core is a Siamese ML-Network, which is adept at comparing pairs of data and learning the subtle differences between them. We also explore different architectures and compare the results. The models are trained using labeled camera data, pre-processed through a pose estimation model to extract the 3D skeletons. We observe a very good separation of features among test subjects.

Traditional MLOps workflows, designed primarily for conventional ML models, struggle to accommodate LLM-specific challenges such as managing embeddings, orchestrating sophisticated data ingestion pipelines, and deploying context-aware intelligent agents at scale. Compounding these difficulties is the requirement to integrate seamlessly with existing enterprise infrastructure, maintain reproducibility and traceability, and ensure optimal performance.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we share our hands-on experience to shed light on the pain points encountered while putting LLMs into production. Attendees will learn about bottlenecks from handling unstructured text data ingestion to scaling vector databases for efficient retrieval and discover how to address them with best tested strategies. We will also discuss the broader open source LLMOps landscape, revealing best practices for pipeline design, version control, model monitoring, and cross-functional collaboration. By sharing these lessons and insights, we aim to deliver our audience with practical knowledge that can be applied to their MLOps/LLMOps stack with any framework or tooling, so they can effectively leverage the power of LLMs for enterprise-scale applications.",

Using GLEIF\u2019s publicly accessible Data Quality Dashboard as an example, we'll discuss how to choose the right open-source tools while balancing business needs and technical feasibility. At the core, the Dashboard builds on popular Python libraries, like FastAPI, Celery, and SQLAlchemy. Attendees will gain insights into avoiding common pitfalls and learn strategies for integrating open-source tools into business use cases.\r\n\r\nThis talk will provide a unique dual perspective, offering actionable insights for both developers and business stakeholders.

Next, we discuss choosing a web framework, focusing on the reasons why FastAPI is ideal for our development and business needs while comparing it to alternatives such as Flask and Django.\r\n\r\nWe then discuss data source integration, detailing the challenges developers face with ORMs such as SQLAlchemy and highlighting the business requirements for long-term data integrity. This is followed by an exploration of performance management, where we explain how task queues optimize compute-intensive tasks and ensure smooth user experiences that are critical for real-time decision-making.\r\n\r\nFinally, we summarise the development of a fully functional open-source dashboard tailored to both business and technical requirements, setting the stage for a dynamic discussion. The session concludes with a Q&A session that encourages participants to share their insights and explore best practices for building custom open-source dashboard solutions.\r\n\r\nThe Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF) is a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting the implementation of the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI).

            "abstract": "Generalized linear models (GLMs) are interpretable, relatively quick to train, and specifying them helps the modeler understand the main effects in the data. This makes them a popular choice today to complement other machine-learning approaches. `glum` was conceived with the aim of offering the community an efficient, feature-rich, and Python-first GLM library with a scikit-learn-style API. More recently, we are striving to keep up with PyData community's ongoing push for dataframe-agnosticism.\r\nWhile `glum` was originally heavily based on `pandas`, with the help of `narwhals`, we are close to being able to fit models on any dataset that the latter supports. This talk presents our experiences with achieving this goal.",
            "description": "Arguably, `glum`'s standout feature is its ability to efficiently handle datasets consisting of a mix of dense, sparse and categorical features. To facilitate this, it relies on our (similarly open-source) `tabmat` library, which provides classes and useful methods for mixed-sparsity data. `glum` fits models by first converting input data to `tabmat` matrices, and then using those matrices to do the necessary computations.\r\n\r\nTherefore, dataframe-agnostism in our case mostly boils down to handling the conversion of different dataframes to `tabmat` matrices (which themselves store data in `numpy` arrays and sparse `scipy` matrices) in an efficient manner. Most of it is rather smooth and straightforward due to `narwhals` providing a convenient compatibility layer for a wide range of dataframe functionality. However, we have encountered a couple of pain points that might be of interest to other package maintainers and the PyData community. In particular,\r\n\r\n- We heavily rely on manipulating the category order and encoding of categorical variables, for which there is somewhat limited support. This is due to various dataframe libraries handling cateegorical columns somewhat differently.\r\n- Most dataframe libraries do not support sparse columns, while for us, it is important to be able to accept sparse inputs.\r\n\r\nIn this talk I demonstrate how we used `narwhals` to easily accept multiple types of dataframes. I will go into details about categorical and sparse columns, and present the challenges we encountered with those. I will also examine the benefits and challenges of supporting sparse columns in dataframe libraries and the Arrow stardard. These points are meant to facilitate discussion among the participants and in the PyData community.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the talk I will also briefly mention potential future plans for `glum` and `tabmat`, including the possibility to do computations directly on Arrow objects without converting them to `numpy` and `scipy` arrays. \r\n\r\n### Outline\r\n\r\n1. A short intro to `glum`, it's backend library `tabmat`, and the main ideas that make them performant.\r\n2. Making `glum` dataframe-agnostic.\r\n    - Showcase how `narwhals` simplifies handling a wide variety of dataframes.\r\n    - Discuss handling categorical (and enum/dictionary) columns.\r\n    - Talk about representing sparse columns in dataframes.\r\n3. Concluding remarks and potential future plans.\r\n\r\n### Target audience\r\n- Basic understanding of the scientific Python ecosystem (with a focus on dataframe libraries) is recommended.\r\n- While some familiarity with linear models might be useful to get the most out of this talk, it is by no means required.\r\n\r\n### Main takeaways\r\n\r\n- How `glum` efficiently handles mixed-sparsity data\r\n- How `narwhals` helps to achieve dataframe-agnosticism with little effort\r\n- Differences between categorical types in various packages and the Apache Arrow specification.\r\n- How support for sparse column could be incorporated into dataframe libraries and the Arrow Columnar Format",

This talk proposed the next grand challenge AI is a completely autonomous scientific breakthrough. The first AI generated discovery that is regarded my numerous human experts as a significant breakthrough and produced with minimal human intervention. The promising fields for this development are mathematics and theoretical physics, especially the Clay Mathematics Institute's Millennium Prize Problems, or a serious contribution towards the grand unified theory of physics. However AI discoveries in other areas such as biology, materials science and neuroscience are also tantalizingly close.\r\n\r\nThe first AI scientific discovery requires pushing the limits of what is possible with today's technology.\r\nLarge language models are ungrounded.

This challenge is an excellent intermediate step; it doesn't necessarily require super-intelligence or consciousness for success, sidestepping these philosophically fraught and possibly dangerous areas. While the success condition of acceptance by prominent human scientists is less specific than beating a human world champion at a game, it is still relatively well defined, compared to something more open to interpretation like artificial general intelligence.\r\n\r\nThe talk will justify AI science as the next great challenge, discuss the ways pursuing it will push AI research forward and outline possible promising approaches.",

However, these calculators fail to cover many important cases, including cases when: some non-parametric analysis method like bootstrap is used to run the hypothesis test; adding covariates to reduce variance (cuped or cupac rely on this); running clustered designs, where the unit of analysis is different than the unit of treatment assignment. cluster-experiments is a library that allows us to run power analysis for any experiment design. Also, in the spirit of \"analyse as you design\", cluster-experiments allows you to do AB test analysis using the same methods you used to design the experiment.",

Yet, implementing causality can be challenging or even infeasible in some contexts. This talk explores how the very act of assessing its applicability can add value to your projects. Through a gentle introduction to causal inference tools and practical use cases, you will learn how to bring greater scientific rigour to real-world problems.\r\n\r\nTarget audience: Practicing and aspiring data scientists, machine learning engineers, and analysts looking to improve their decision-making with causal inference. \r\n\r\nNo prior knowledge is assumed. \r\n\r\nFor the seasoned practitioners I hope to shine light on aspects that may not have been considered. \ud83d\udca1",
            "description": "This talk aims to provide practitioners with a practical understanding of causal reasoning and its applications in real-world projects. It moves beyond the hype surrounding causal inference (CI) as the \"next big thing\" and encourages a critical assessment of its strengths and limitations.\r\n\r\n**Outline**\r\n\r\n* Introduction: The Allure and the Reality of Causality\r\n* Case Study: A Paradox in Machine Learning\r\n* Causal Graphs\r\n    * as Blueprints for Causal Thinking\r\n    * Building by *Causal Discovery*\r\n* Assessing Applicability with *Identifiability*\r\n* Summary and Resources\r\n\r\n\r\n**Central Thesis**  \r\nAlthough causal inference techniques have immense potential, their practical application requires careful consideration of context and limitations. The act of engaging in causality is valuable in its own right, promoting a more rigorous and insightful approach to a project. In particular, \"causal thinking\" through Causal Graph construction and critical assessment of assumptions, is a mental exercise that enhances project rigour which may lead to a deeper understanding of what is possible with the data.\r\n\r\n**In Detail**  \r\nA key focus will be on *Directed Acyclic Graphs* (DAGs) as powerful tools for causal thinking. They provide a visual aid of the data generation process, mapping out the relationships between different parameters and their dependencies. We'll examine how DAGs can articulate the understanding of a system. A second focus will be on *Identifiability* a process of identifying minimum sets of parameters required to answer specific questions about cause and effect.\r\n\r\n**Key Takeaways**  \r\nThis talk will equip you with a practical framework for:\r\n\r\n* Building a DAG as a visualisation tool to communicate your understanding of the data generation process and assess the level of control you have over the system being studied.\r\n* Using Identifiability on a DAG to assess the applicability of CI to your own projects, considering factors like data availability, project goals.\r\n\r\nBy doing so you will embrace \"causal thinking\" as a mental hygiene practice that can benefit any data science project, even if formal CI techniques cannot be employed.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the end of this talk, you'll have a nuanced understanding of CI, going beyond the hype to appreciate its true potential and limitations. You'll be better equipped to assess when it's is the right tool for the job, and you'll gain valuable insights into how \"causal thinking\" can enhance your work as a data scientist, especially with real-world data.",

And therein lies the problem: can an AI agent be made secure when even an LLM is not secure?\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will examine the current ecosystem surrounding the security of AI agents. How do you prevent an AI agent from performing a task it is not supposed to perform? As an example, we will consider the current \u201cCapture the Flag\u201d competition \u201cAdaptive Prompt Injection: LLMail Inject,\u201d which is part of the 3rd IEEE Conference on Secure and Trustworthy Machine Learning. This competition challenges participants to determine whether they can get an AI agent to send an email with certain content, even though the user is only asking for a summary.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, it addresses the vulnerabilities of the models Microsoft\u2019s Phi3 and OpenAI\u2019s GPT4-o-mini. Depending on the scenario, these models are protected by mechanisms such as a so-called LLM judge, task drift, prompt shields, spotlighting, or instruction hierarchy. All these procedures and models are also used in the Azure cloud and can be transferred to on-premises environments using open-source solutions. In 2025, this topic will become more urgent because, starting in August, the EU AI Act will require that general-purpose AI\u2014including LLMs\u2014be secured by state-of-the-art security concepts. This provides even more reason to examine the methods currently available and learn about their advantages and disadvantages.\r\n\r\nWhich leaves us with the question: Is my AI agent secure?

            "description": "This project implements advanced Python-based algorithms to enhance relation extraction (RE) in German legal texts, addressing challenges like data scarcity and linguistic complexity. The focus is on two few-shot learning methods: Meta-Learning and Prototypical Networks with Contrastive Loss, optimized for low-resource settings using Python frameworks such as PyTorch and Hugging Face Transformers.\r\n\r\n1. Meta-Learning (MAML)\r\nMeta-Learning allows rapid model adaptation with minimal data. Using PyTorch, we implement Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) in a two-loop optimization process:\r\nInner Loop: Task-specific updates using few-shot examples (support set).\r\nOuter Loop: Meta-parameters refined across tasks to improve generalization.\r\nEpisodic training ensures the model learns task-level patterns effectively, supporting adaptation to new relations.\r\n\r\n2. Prototypical Networks with Contrastive Loss\r\nPrototypical Networks classify examples by computing class prototypes (average embeddings) and measuring query distances. Contrastive Loss enhances class separability by minimizing intra-class distance and maximizing inter-class margins. Pre-trained language models like BERT, fine-tuned with Hugging Face, generate embeddings for entity pairs in legal texts.\r\n\r\n3. Synthetic Data Generation\r\nLarge language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 are used to generate synthetic data, addressing annotated dataset scarcity. Python APIs ensure efficient integration, and manually validated examples enrich training datasets.\r\n\r\n4. Implementation Workflow\r\nKey tools include:\r\nData Processing: Pandas and NLTK for preprocessing.\r\nModel Training: PyTorch for custom architectures and Hugging Face for embedding generation.\r\nEvaluation: Scikit-learn for metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.\r\n\r\n5. Experimental Design\r\nThe models are trained using episodic few-shot frameworks with K-shot examples. Experiments compare MAML and Prototypical Networks, with ablation studies isolating the impact of meta-learning and contrastive loss.\r\n\r\nOutcomes\r\nThe implementation delivers a reproducible Python-based RE tool, optimized for low-resource NLP tasks, with significant potential for legal and domain-specific applications.",

By querying external databases or documents during text generation, RAG addresses key challenges like hallucinations and enhances fact-based responses. However, the dynamic nature of user behavior, query patterns, and system updates makes monitoring data drift essential to ensure RAG applications' long-term reliability and performance.\r\n\r\nMonitoring data drift in RAG applications is crucial to maintaining their reliability and performance over time. In this tutorial, we explore the drifts that can affect RAG systems and discuss their impact on performance. We will further explore how to monitor LLM drift using Evidently, an open-source tool designed for monitoring machine learning models. The session will include a live demonstration of Evidently\u2019s Reports, Test Suites, and Monitoring Dashboard.\u00a0Attendees will gain practical insights into maintaining the efficacy of RAG applications in the face of evolving data distributions, user behavior, and system updates.",
            "description": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is revolutionizing the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) by enabling real-time data retrieval to produce accurate, up-to-date, and contextually relevant outputs. However, the dynamic nature of user behavior, data, system components, and operational environments poses challenges to maintaining the long-term reliability of RAG systems. This tutorial delves into the concept of drift, which occurs when subtle changes in these elements disrupt a system's performance, and presents actionable strategies to monitor and mitigate it effectively.\r\n\r\nThrough a hands-on demonstration using Evidently AI, attendees will learn to monitor these drifts in RAG systems. The session will leverage a Google Colab notebook with a practical example dataset, teaching participants how to prepare data using Evidently\u2019s ColumnMapping object and evaluate it using various analytical techniques. Metrics such as text length, word count, and out-of-vocabulary percentages will be employed to detect shifts in user behavior. Additionally, pattern-based analysis and sentiment drift tracking will be covered, with a focus on identifying domain-specific trends and shifts in user sentiment over time.\r\n\r\nThe tutorial will also highlight advanced techniques, including using LLM-as-a-Judge, where OpenAI\u2019s models can be leveraged to define and monitor custom qualitative metrics like toxicity. Semantic similarity analysis will be demonstrated to track alignment between user queries and system responses. By combining Evidently's robust monitoring tools with Langtrace's capabilities, participants will understand how to maintain the efficacy and reliability of RAG systems in dynamic environments.",

            "abstract": "As a developer, you play a crucial role in the security of your projects. At the same time, security is but one of the many responsibilities a developer has to fulfill these days. It almost seems like you must be an expert in just about anything!\r\n\r\nThankfully, you don't have to be a security expert to contribute to the security of your projects. In this talk, I will show you how to approach security systematically without feeling overwhelmed.\r\n\r\nFirst, I will discuss some background on security theory and my take on the role of developers in security. This discussion will include the difficult topic of advocating for security with product owners and stakeholders. Then, I will introduce you to open-source industry standards, such as the [OWASP DevSecOps Maturity Model](https://owasp.org/www-project-devsecops-maturity-model/), that you can use to start implementing security in your projects.\r\n\r\nBy the end of my talk, you will not be a security expert, but you should have enough pointers to get started with security!",
            "description": "If you've been a developer somewhere in the past two decades, you've probably noticed the push for shifting security \"left\" in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). While this doesn't mean that security wasn't a concern for developers before, there is an increasing emphasis on security earlier in the development process.\r\n\r\nOn paper, this sounds great, but security isn't the only responsibility that has been added to or increased in emphasis on the developer's plate. We cannot shift left _everything_ and expect developers to become experts in _everything_. That just isn't scalable.\r\n\r\nThat is why I will start my talk by discussing the role of developers in security. I will talk about security culture, the shift-left movement, the responsibilities of software developers, and how you can manage them without being overwhelmed.\r\n\r\nI will not ignore the difficult topic that haunts us all: How do you advocate for security as a developer? While many organizations shout about their security ambitions, most product owners and stakeholders still need convincing that good security takes time.\r\n\r\nWhile doing so, I will also introduce some core security concepts and frameworks to help you think about security. While many of us are familiar with individual components such as security scanners and secure coding patterns to avoid common vulnerabilities, the bigger picture you get from zooming out helps you determine which security practices you should prioritize in your project.\r\n\r\nIn the second part of my talk, I will turn to the more practical side of security: How do you get started with security?\r\n\r\nLuckily, we can rely on the expertise of others in this area: We can turn to open-source industry standards for guidance. Specifically, I will introduce you to the [OWASP DevSecOps Maturity Model](https://owasp.org/www-project-devsecops-maturity-model/). This model is especially accessible to developers and gives you concrete practices to implement in your workflow.\r\n\r\nBy the end of this talk, you should have the guidance you need to get started with security!",

I don't think a mini-lecture with too many details on a framework is very useful or effective. It's much better if people get interested during the talk and dive into the frameworks in detail in their own time.\r\n\r\nObviously, I will still give a general overview of the DevSecOps Maturity Model and discuss how you can use it as a guide for improving your security practices.

            "description": "Within a national railroad network, construction work for maintenance and modernization is unavoidable - as is train traffic on the affected sections under certain circumstances. Although there are fixed timetables for passenger rail transport that are planned well in advance and are set very early, there are still many freight transports and special trains that are registered at short notice and cause a dynamic traffic situation on the rail network. Therefore, the capacity utilisation of the rail routes is unknown until shortly before the journey takes place. It is therefore important to estimate the number of trains that will run over the affected tracks in order to establish a sensible re-routing strategy. Until now, this process has been in the hands of human decision-makers for decades or even more than a century.\r\n\r\nDemographic change and staff shortages are increasingly forcing companies to automate activities intelligently. This is where machine learning and artificial intelligence come into play.\r\n\r\nAs Deutsche Bahn's IT service provider, DB Systel GmbH was able to successfully implement an example of intelligent automation of this process and estimate train numbers on sections of tracks affected by construction using modern ML and AI methods. Python as well as various established frameworks (Pandas, scikit-learn, NumPy, PyTorch) and new frameworks (Polars, Ruff) were used in this project. A success and performance measurement clearly demonstrated the benefits of ML automation.",

Traditional querying methods often fall short when faced with the sheer volume of data and the need for real-time responses. This is where Bloom Filters, a probabilistic data structure, shine by dramatically improving query performance and reducing resource overhead.\r\n\r\nThis talk will introduce Bloom Filters, explore their internal mechanics, and discuss their practical applications in large-scale systems. Through real-world examples and case studies, attendees will learn how some of the largest institutions in the world utilize Bloom Filters to handle billions of queries efficiently, maintain scalability, and optimize system performance.",
            "description": "Mega-services like search engines, social networks, and e-commerce platforms face a common challenge: handling massive datasets with minimal latency. Querying databases directly for simple checks, such as whether a key exists, can result in significant performance bottlenecks, especially as datasets scale to billions or trillions of entries. These inefficiencies not only slow down applications but also increase computational and memory overhead, straining resources and driving up costs.\r\n\r\nTraditional caching solutions provide some relief but are not always sufficient for scenarios requiring extreme efficiency. This has led to the adoption of Bloom Filters, a space-efficient probabilistic data structure that addresses these challenges by offering fast and lightweight membership checks with a controllable false-positive rate.",

This talk explores the technical challenges that arise when feature engineering requires distributed computing frameworks, blurring traditional boundaries between ML modeling and engineering roles. Through a retail case study, we examine practical solutions in parallel data processing, including architectural decisions around class granularity and data structures. Drawing from project experiences, we discuss how parallelization requirements influence feature design, model development, and production deployment, demonstrating why success in big data ML projects requires deep collaboration between modeling and engineering teams.",
            "description": "In this talk, we discuss the challenges of developing machine learning features on big data that require a parallelization and scaling framework. \r\n\r\nTo begin with, we take a brief look at the roles involved in the development of a ML model through to production. In theory, a feature store is developed under the leadership of one or more data engineers. The data scientist takes care of the logic, creates feature ideas, tests and develops a model and then takes the next steps together with the ML engineer. But is this separation that simple to make?  \r\n\r\nWith large amounts of data, parallelization frameworks are generally used not only for preprocessing but also for feature engineering. During the training phase alone, it may not be sufficient or even possible to keep feature ideas and mathematical modeling within a lab environment. This is where the roles in a project meet and overlap. \r\n\r\nNext, we will take a brief look at the common parallelization and scaling tools, including the frameworks offered by the common cloud providers. We will learn how these can support us in efficient data processing. \r\n\r\nThen we get more specific. What can a Pure Python data model to be processed in parallel look like in practice? We will use an example of point of sale and article level time series in retail to illustrate this and learn about the advantages of nested structures. Further questions quickly arise: At what granularity should the classes be cut? What do we gain from it? What do we lose by doing so regarding the underlying processing cluster? Instead of shuffling within a cluster, so-called side inputs can help.  \r\n\r\nThe consideration of the later model application in production, i.e. the use of a feature store also for the creation of an inference data set, places further demand on the data models.  \r\n\r\nI share project-experiences made on the arising trade-offs and challenges and how we can tackle those. We will conclude that parallelization is a way of thinking that needs to be internalized by all project members. The technical solution will be unique to each project. But there is one thing that AI projects on big data have in common: you can only be successful as a team.",

            "description": "As astronomical surveys continue to grow in size and sophistication, researchers face mounting challenges in building efficient, scalable, and reproducible data processing pipelines. Modern observatories, like NASA's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), are delivering unprecedented volumes of complex and specialized data, requiring innovative approaches to transform raw observations into meaningful, scientifically valid results. This talk focuses on leveraging Pythonic workflow management tools to address the unique challenges of processing large-scale astronomical datasets efficiently and reproducibly.\r\n\r\nI will provide a brief overview of JWST including its capabilities and the groundbreaking science it has enabled. In particular we will focus on the Pure Parallel mode which collect serendipitous observations from regions of the sky adjacent to primary science targets. These opportunistic datasets are a powerful resource for blind extragalactic surveys, offering unique opportunities to uncover faint galaxies, cosmic structures, and rare astrophysical phenomena. However, their \u201cunscheduled\u201d and heterogeneous nature presents significant challenges: the data arrive in raw, uncalibrated formats and require intricate, multi-step workflows\u2014such as artifact masking, background subtraction, and galaxy spectral analysis\u2014before becoming scientifically usable.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will demonstrate how tools like Snakemake and Pixi offer powerful, Pythonic solutions for these challenges. I\u2019ll show how these tools allow scientists to design modular, scalable, and highly parallel workflows that automate the reduction and analysis process while efficiently distributing computation across high-performance computing (HPC) clusters and cloud environments. By breaking workflows into smaller, reusable components, we can improve computational performance and maintain flexibility to adapt pipelines to new datasets, instruments, or evolving scientific goals.\r\n\r\nReproducibility remains a critical pillar of modern science, and I will highlight how combining workflow managers with environment management tools ensures version-controlled pipelines, transparent data lineage tracking, and reliable replication of results. This enables consistent analyses across diverse systems, fostering collaboration and long-term usability of scientific products.\r\n\r\nThis talk is designed for (data) scientists and researchers working with large-scale or complex datasets with multi-step reduction/analysis pipelines. This talk will provide a GitHub repository containing resources for building modular workflows, including examples of existing infrastructures, to provide actionable takeaways. Attendees will leave with a clear understanding of how to apply modern workflow management techniques to streamline their processing pipelines, improve reproducibility, and scale their analyses to meet the demands of their datasets.",

The pipeline, built with open-source tools, supports both CPU and GPU inference leveraging tools such as Modal and Hugging Face. It is designed to be modular and customizable for different use cases. Learn how you can build such a pipeline to efficiently scale your Machine Learning Inference workflows and why we opted for Celery as a lightweight, flexible solution over other orchestration tools like SageMaker, or Airflow.",
            "description": "Extracting insights from a few thousand data points with a machine learning model is usually simple, but when scaling to millions of data points or daily extractions, the process becomes much more complex. It demands robust infrastructure, systematic monitoring, efficient workflows, and strategies to tackle long processing times.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we present a flexible and scalable pipeline designed to perform inference on millions of job postings integrating multiple Machine Learning Models. The pipeline is built entirely with open-source tools, while being theoretically scaleable across different machines like cloud or on-premise. Built with Celery and Flower, the pipeline is capable of orchestrate the entire extraction workflow, including document processing, inference, cloud storage, result verification, and database integration. This approach is demonstrated with a practical use case: historical and daily data extractions of job postings.\r\n\r\nThe architecture supports both CPU and GPU inference, with GPU tasks handled via Modal, a serverless cloud solution. The Models are hosted on Hugging Face. Although we presenting this pipeline with these specific Tools, the pipeline has a modular structure and enables the integration and replacement of alternative hosting solutions or technologies. This makes it adaptable to other stacks and use cases.\r\n\r\nWe will demonstrate how to construct such a pipeline, share our best practices and experiences, and highlight why we chose Celery as our orchestration tool. We will discuss Celery\u2019s scalability and flexibility, and how it addresses challenges such as handling sensitive data and optimizing resource use. Whether you're deploying ML models in production or scaling inference workflows, this talk provides actionable insights and practical strategies to elevate your machine learning projects.",

It is best practice for any API-first company to have API Versioning in one way or another. Otherwise, the company will either be unable to improve their API or their clients will have their integrations broken every few months.\r\n\r\nAt Monite, we spent a great deal of time trying to make API versioning work. We went through multiple horrifying solutions until we reached something we are proud of. I'll share just how expensive API versioning can get if done incorrectly.\r\n\r\nI'll cover all sorts of approaches you can pick to add incompatible features to your API: extremely stable and expensive, easy-looking but horrible in practice, and even completely version-less yet viable.

            "notes": "API versioning is hard, very hard; and lack of resources does not help at all. I want this talk to become a beacon to anyone lost in it, to be the first resource that makes a real overview of all major problems and solutions to them. Note that there does not exist the right way to version but there certainly exists the wrong way to version.\r\n\r\nAt Monite, we provide invoicing and payments APIs to B2Bs all over the world. However, as a startup we are still rapidly changing. As a result, we need to make breaking changes in our API all the time. To make sure that our clients do not have to re-integrate with us every few weeks, we started doing API versioning early. Sadly, we have tried one of the less effective approaches. It proved so painful and expensive that I decided to research everything about API versioning in existence. There are many approaches at different levels of isolation but the most effective ones version strictly the API without touching the database and only minimally touching business logic. One of such effective approaches is applied at Stripe so I contacted the author of their API versioning and developed an open-source framework based on our discussion.\r\n\r\nAfter making an overview of all existing approaches, I will be talking about the methodology and benefits of our approach. Essentially if you already have a framework or can develop one, having many versions becomes easy and backporting features to all prior versions becomes cheap. The same approach allowed Stripe to maintain backward compatibility with every version since Stripe's inception in 2011.\r\n\r\nThe core of the methodology is to encapsulate the changes between versions into small \"compatibility gates\" that are independent of your business logic. They mainly describe three things: what has changed, how to convert a request from the prior version to the request of the next version, and how to convert a response from the next version to the response of the prior version. These compatibility gates thus form a chain of migrations: they get automatically applied to every request one after another. This chain effectively turns any request into the request of the latest version and turns the responses from the latest version into responses for any version requested by the client. Thus, you have business logic that handles a single version yet your API can support years worth of versions with minimal maintenance overhead.\r\n\r\nThis talk will introduce the audience to all necessary concepts and will provide links to all useful resources for anyone who wants to thoroughly research API versioning or build a modern solution themselves.\r\n\r\n* (1.5 min) What will you see if you try to research API versioning right now?\r\n  * hundreds of articles on where to put the version\r\n  * Simplistic approaches that are not viable for many versions or for long-term support\r\n  * Platform-specific solutions\r\n  * A single Stripe article describing an advanced versioning technique\r\n* (2 min) A quick description of best practices from \"hundreds of articles\" (use dates or numbers, put them into a header, leave /v1/ there for the future) because this information is so easily searchable that we should not spend much time on it\r\n* (5 min) A set of issues that don't seem to be covered anywhere.\r\n  * How do you maintain many versions at the same time?\r\n  * What happens if your versions are incompatible in terms of data?\r\n  * How do you deprecate versions if you have many clients?\r\n  * How do you keep your developers sane when versioning?\r\n  * (Note for the committee: The answers to all of these questions depend on the use case and are related to picking the right layer to version, taking the right approach from that layer, and then implementing it correctly. The concrete recommendations will be included in the classification sections.)\r\n* (5 min) Layered classification of API versioning\r\n  * Average API Application consists of three layers: Model, Business Logic, API (similar to MVC but orthogonal to it)\r\n  * When you version, you choose the layer you want to duplicate between versions. If you duplicate a layer, you must duplicate all layers above it\r\n  * We will use this model to understand and classify API versioning approaches\r\n  * The larger piece of logic we duplicate -- the more expensive the approach is to maintain. However, the smaller piece we duplicate -- the more sophisticated our API versioning framework will need to be.\r\n* (7 min) A per-layer classification of the majority of existing API versioning approaches\r\n  * Model\r\n    * Separate deployments with separate databases (expensive but rock-solid stable)\r\n    * Separate deployments with the same database  (expensive and stable but need to be cautious with database changes)\r\n  * Business logic\r\n    * Full business logic and API duplication (feels cheap but instantly turns any project into a mess if there is no advanced infrastructure to support it)\r\n    * Per-route versioning (cheap and simple but quickly turns the project into a mess on many versions)\r\n  * API\r\n    * Per-version serializers (cheap at first but hard to support with many versions)\r\n    * Stripe's Compatibility Gates (expensive to start but cheap to support years worth of versions)\r\n    * GraphQL (expensive for both your developers and your partners' developers but allows for a version-less approach)\r\n    * Yaml API-builder approach used at SuperJob (extremely expensive to start and learn but can be comparable to Stripe's approach in terms of maintainability)\r\n* (7 min) Description of our API versioning approach\r\n  * Latest version and why we want to stay on it\r\n  * Compatibility gates and how they work\r\n  * How compatibility gates can create an easily maintainable chain that makes versioning easy\r\n* Final recommendation: \"Avoid versioning at all costs for as long as you can. It is expensive, painful, and introduces so many issues you would never encounter otherwise. But if you can't and need to support a large number of versions and clients: The approach that Stripe and Monite chose is probably your best bet to keep your sanity.\"\r\n\r\nLinks for reference:\r\n\r\n* <https://github.com/zmievsa/cadwyn>\r\n* <https://stripe.com/blog/api-versioning>\r\n* <https://habr.com/ru/companies/superjob/articles/577650/>\r\n* <https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2022/-under-the-hood--how-we-built-api-versioning-for-linkedin-market>\r\n* <https://smartlogic.io/blog/2012-12-12-developing-an-api/>\r\n* <https://thenewstack.io/tricks-api-versioning/>\r\n* <https://github.com/dotnet/aspnet-api-versioning>\r\n* <https://github.com/sjkaliski/pinned>\r\n* <https://github.com/phillbaker/gates>\r\n* <https://github.com/lukepolo/laravel-api-migrations>\r\n* <https://github.com/tomschlick/request-migrations>\r\n* <https://github.com/keygen-sh/request_migrations>",

This talk presents an innovative methodology for detecting and predicting collusion patterns in different national markets using neural networks (NNs) and graph neural networks (GNNs). GNNs are particularly well suited to this task because they can exploit the inherent network structures present in collusion and many other economic problems. In Python, we use PyTorch and the Deep Graph Library (DGL) to develop and train models on individual market datasets from Japan, the United States, two regions in Switzerland, Italy, and Brazil, focusing on predicting collusion in single markets. In our empirical study, we show that GNNs outperform NNs in detecting complex collusive patterns. This research contributes to the ongoing discourse on preventing collusion and optimizing detection methodologies, providing valuable guidance on the use of NNs and GNNs in economic applications to enhance market fairness and economic welfare.",
            "description": "Collusion detection is a critical process for identifying instances in which entities, such as companies or individuals, secretly collaborate to engage in fraudulent practices, often characterized by agreements on prices, market shares, or tactics to avoid competition. GNNs explicitly allow the incorporation of network structures, which are prevalent in collusion and key to improving the detection rate. This talk tackles the challenge of detecting fraud patterns using GNNs and highlights how these models can effectively learn network structures inherent in bidding markets.\r\nWe propose a fraud detection algorithm that uses relational graph convolutional networks (R-GCNs) to analyze the inherent network structures in bidding data. R-GCNs have the ability to assign different weights to different types of edges. By using this extension of GNNs, different types of relationships between the bids can be combined to generate richer node embeddings, making them more effective at detecting collusive behavior among companies participating in bids and tenders. We develop and train these models using the PyTorch framework and the Deep Graph Library (DGL), applying them to datasets from Japan, the United States, Switzerland, Italy, and Brazil. Our empirical findings show that GNNs outperform traditional NNs in identifying complex collusive patterns, offering a new solution to this fraud problem.\r\nFor data scientists, especially those working with network data, the detection of anomalous patterns in network structures is a critical challenge across different domains, e.g. financial fraud detection or social network analysis. Attendees will gain practical strategies for applying GNNs to classification tasks to detect patterns in network data and a deeper understanding of how graph embeddings can enhance fraud detection models.",

            "description": "# Advanced Web Scraping: From LEGO to Production\r\n\r\nToday's web landscape is teeming with JavaScript-heavy content, complex layouts, and sometimes opaque data structures. But what if you could reliably scrape rich product information\u2014images, specs, descriptions\u2014from modern e-commerce sites without hitting constant roadblocks? This session tackles advanced scraping with Python, Scrapy, and Playwright, exemplified by data extraction from LEGO product pages. We'll explore a \"grey hat\" perspective\u2014applying a slightly \"hacky\" mindset\u2014while stressing practical ethics, performance considerations, and compliance with site policies.\r\n\r\n## Outline\r\n\r\n### 1. Introduction: The Hacky Spirit vs. Ethical Constraints\r\n- Why scrape LEGO?\r\n- Setting boundaries: terms of service, rate limiting, and disclaimers\r\n- When \"scraping for fun\" crosses into potential legal pitfalls\r\n\r\n### 2. Scraping Tech Stack Overview\r\n- Scrapy for structured crawling and item pipelines\r\n- Playwright for rendering JavaScript and handling dynamic elements\r\n- Comparison to traditional HTML-only approaches\r\n- Project structure, environment setup, and practical tips\r\n\r\n### 3. Spiders in Action\r\n- Product Spider: Extracting core product data (ID, name, specifications, multiple images)\r\n- Gallery Spider: Navigating hidden galleries, handling tricky JS-based carousels, and filtering unwanted images\r\n- Ensuring consistent output (JSON or database ingestion)\r\n\r\n### 4. Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration\r\n- Definition: Leveraging specialized helper servers for orchestrating data fetching, refining selectors, and automating debugging\r\n- Chaining Large Language Models: Code suggestions, auto-generation of selectors, and reactive error handling\r\n- Example workflow: \"Broken selector? Ask the MCP server for an LLM-aided fix\"\r\n\r\n### 5. Performance & Scale\r\n- Polite but robust concurrency: balancing speed and TOS compliance\r\n- Handling large link lists, incremental updates, and site changes\r\n- Monitoring and logging for reliability, debugging, and optimization\r\n\r\n### 6. Ethics & Privacy\r\n- Respecting site ownership, disclaimers, and usage limits\r\n- Storing scraped data securely and avoiding personal information\r\n- A discussion of \"grey hat\" territory: testing site vulnerabilities without exploiting them\r\n\r\n### 7. Use Cases & Extensions\r\n- Research software engineering: building reproducible data sets\r\n- Robotics and embedded: offline or partial data ingestion for classification or motion planning\r\n- Future directions: advanced concurrency, containerization, and HPC\r\n\r\n### 8. Demo & Q&A\r\n- Live snippet showing an MCP-powered spider reacting to a changed DOM structure\r\n- Q&A session on bridging the gap between hackery and best practices\r\n\r\n## Key Takeaways\r\n- Techniques for scraping dynamic, JS-heavy sites using Python, Scrapy, and Playwright\r\n- Practical \"hacky\" methods balanced by responsible, 'ethical approaches'\r\n- Introduction to Model Context Protocol servers for automated code refinement\r\n- Scalable patterns for data handling, from small tests to large-scale deployments\r\n\r\nWhether you're a data engineer, hobbyist, or researcher, this talk provides a robust (and slightly subversive) recipe for capturing essential data from the wild world of modern websites\u2014without crossing into unethical or unlawful territory.",

In other words, we will ask the question **whether we have enough publicly available time-series data to train foundational models**, and how this can **affect such models' evaluation**.\r\n\r\nFinally, we will display how we attempted to **benchmark those models against a robust baseline of models**, and where our experiment is compared to the publicly available results.\r\n\r\nNo specific prior knowledge is required for attendance. Though forecasting practitioners stand to gain the most from this talk, every practitioner in machine learning or generative AI can follow along and draw the key conclusions.\r\n\r\n**Outline**\r\nMinutes 1-3. Problem statement: challenges in adapting transformers to the time-series domain.\r\nMinutes 3-10. How Chronos and Moirai are implemented.\r\nMinutes 10-15. Do we have enough data to train universal forecasters?\r\nMinutes 15-25. Lessons learnt from evaluating transformer-based models for a specific use-case.\r\nMinutes 25-30. Wrap up and Q&A.",

            "description": "The European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) are now in effect, requiring most companies across the EU to report on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors. These standards aim to increase transparency and accountability, requiring businesses to disclose data that reflects their sustainability efforts in both quantitative and qualitative ways. Companies must report on a vast number of specific ESG metrics, as well as provide descriptions of their actions, goals, and plans in these areas.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will explore how data scientists are in a unique position to support organizations in navigating the ESRS. The standards require data professionals to handle both quantitative metrics\u2014like carbon emissions, energy use and other performance indicators\u2014and qualitative data such as action plans, sustainability goals, and strategies. I want to demonstrate where we as data scientists can bridge the gap between raw data and actionable insights, ensuring accuracy in reporting, developing workflows for data integration, and helping our organizations articulate their sustainability efforts effectively.\r\n\r\nI will also highlight some of the key challenges companies face when gathering and reporting ESG data, such as data gaps, inconsistencies, and the complexities of integrating data from different sources.

We\u2019ll walk you through the basics of an FL system, how to iterate on your workflow and code in a research setting, and finally deploy your code to a production environment. You will learn all of these approaches using a real-world application based on open-sourced datasets, and the open-source federated AI framework, [Flower](https://github.com/adap/flower), which is written in Python and designed for Python users. Throughout the tutorial, you\u2019ll have access to hands-on open-sourced code examples to follow along.",
            "description": "Federated Learning has quickly become the preferred form of training of AI models when the training data cannot leave their point of origin due to privacy regulations (e.g. GDPR), legal constraints (e.g. in different jurisdictions), and logistical challenges (e.g. large volumes of data, sparse connectivity), among other reasons. Furthermore, contracts and regulations establish boundaries for data sharing, particularly in industries like healthcare and finance, where misuse prevention is crucial. One could also argue that we are [running out of publicly and ethically sourced datasets](https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/13/24320811/what-ilya-sutskever-sees-openai-model-data-training), for instance to [scale large foundational models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08892), and federated learning offers one way to train models on protected data.\r\n\r\nThe key point of this tutorial is to introduce an alternative approach to training AI models that is straightforward and accessible.\r\n\r\nThis tutorial is sequenced in 3 parts. We\u2019ll first introduce federated learning and its prototypical architecture. In part 2, we\u2019ll dive into a series of live Python code demos that showcase how to convert a classical centralized machine learning workflow into a federated workflow involving multiple federated clients. We\u2019ll demonstrate the similarities and differences of how the iteration of a federated research project is conducted. Finally, in part 3, we\u2019ll demonstrate how you can take your research code and deploy it in a production setting using a mixture of physical edge devices and VMs.\r\n\r\nThroughout the tutorial, we\u2019ll use [Flower](https://github.com/adap/flower), the fully open-sourced federated AI framework, which is written in Python and designed for Python users. With simplicity as one of it\u2019s main goals, Flower provides multiple features and libraries to accelerate research, such as [Flower Baselines](https://flower.ai/docs/baselines/) (for reproducing federated learning benchmarks) and [Flower Datasets](https://flower.ai/docs/datasets/) (a standalone Python library for easily creating federated datasets). We\u2019ll showcase how to use the Flower CLI in both research and production setting.\r\n\r\nThis tutorial addresses people with fluency in Python, CLI, and basic knowledge of a machine learning project. It would help if you\u2019ve also used Docker before. Any data practitioner is encouraged to attend the tutorial to learn and discuss how to federate and distribute the training of an ML model. \r\n\r\nYou will learn:\r\n\r\n- What\u2019s Federated Learning?\r\n    - Basics and real-world examples\r\n- How to federate your existing ML training code, and more FL-specific steps such as how to:\r\n    - Configure the behaviours of each federated client\r\n    - Persist the state of each client across global rounds\r\n    - Evaluate both aggregated and local models\r\n    - Standardize your FL experiments\r\n    - Track your experiments\r\n- How to deploy your research code in a production setting, such as how to:\r\n    - Deploy Flower federated learning clients using Docker\r\n    - Set-up secure connection and node authentication\r\n    - Run, monitory, and manage the federated learning runs.\r\n\r\nBring your own laptop if you\u2019d like to follow along. Some code examples will be executed in Google Colab, others can be locally executed on your favourite IDE. A GitHub repo containing the code examples will be shared before the event.\r\n\r\nThe tutorial session is structured in the following way:\r\n\r\n- 0:00 Introduction, and getting to know the audience.\r\n- 0:05 What\u2019s Federated Learning? Basics and real-world-examples.\r\n- 0:25 Overview of the Flower framework for federated learning\r\n- 0:30 Quickstart examples with PyTorch.

            "description": "Building a machine learning (ML) model is a significant investment of time and resources, involving data collection, processing, model selection, training, evaluation, and optimization. But what happens when the business objective shifts after all this effort? In this talk, I will share my experience of adapting a churn-prediction model into a flexible retention insights tool, showcasing how we can adjust models to meet evolving business needs without starting from scratch.\r\n\r\nIn one of my previous projects as a data scientist, I initially developed a model to predict churn based on user behavior data\u2014an objective common across many industries. However, when the results were presented to internal stakeholders, their feedback was unexpected. Customer success managers, already familiar with traditional churn metrics, weren\u2019t interested in predictions but instead wanted insights into user behaviors just before churn occurred. To respond, I adapted the model by focusing on the features and coefficients rather than the predictions themselves. This shift led to surprising insights: the same model, originally designed to predict churn, now identified key events related to retention. Product managers were thrilled and proposed running campaigns to promote these retention-positive behaviors. This new direction, however, presented another challenge: estimating the effectiveness of each campaign. We leveraged the same model to simulate the potential impact of these campaigns on retention. By adjusting the model inputs to reflect hypothetical campaign actions, we could identify low-effort, high-impact initiatives. This not only helped optimize campaign strategy but also enhanced the model's interpretability by adding context to the insights. \r\n\r\nThis project is a great example of how a single model can unlock unexpected value when creatively repurposed. We, as data scientists, can leverage our modelling and business knowledge to maximize the impact of our work. We can build, repurpose and reevaluate. In my talk, I will also share practical tips from my experience on how this can be done effectively, such as early and diverse feedback from stakeholders to ensure real business needs are met, and robust model evaluation metrics to ensure quality is maintained.",

            "description": "Assume you're already developing a computer vision system utilizing an ML platform, such as AWS Sagemaker. You'll quickly see that it lacks dedicated functionality for effective computer vision development. SageMaker provides data scientists and machine learning engineers with significant computational resources and a robust MLOps platform. However, it is not designed for the seamless execution of computer vision dataset management, model monitoring, and evaluation. \r\n\r\nFor instance, its data sources (S3, LFS, or most existing Datalakes) don\u2019t provide the flexibility for direct and effective annotation, optimized management of annotation artifacts, and visual examination capabilities. Also, its evaluation capabilities are not optimized to flag vision-specific issues such as occlusion or image quality.\r\n\r\nData scientists or ML engineers often need to utilize various tools and platforms to effectively handle vision data (i.e., images or videos) or efficiently evaluate CV model performance. Accommodating these extra components can convolute their MLOps setup.\r\n\r\nThey need a seamless and scaleable way to mitigate the bottlenecks of managing computer vision data and efficiently evaluating their computer vision models in production when leveraging a powerful ML platform like SageMaker for running training and experiment jobs. \r\n\r\nThis talk demonstrates the use of the specialized CVOp cloud-agnostic platform (Picsellia) with their existing ML platform like AWS SageMaker to streamline computer vision workflows efficiently without using many tools or platforms. This involves leveraging SageMaker\u2019s robust ML capabilities and Picsellia for vision dataset management, model monitoring, and evaluation. \r\n\r\nBy the end of this session, participants will:\r\n- Understand the key challenges in managing computer vision workflows.\r\n- Learn how to integrate Picsellia with AWS SageMaker to optimize CVOps processes.\r\n- Gain hands-on knowledge on managing vision datasets and monitoring and evaluating their computer vision models.",

The math-y section of the talk, explaining how to translate parameter counts into memory and compute requirements.\r\n\r\n**Prefill and Decoding** (8 min) Explains that inference happens in two steps (prefill and decoding) and how KV-cache exploits this to make decoding faster. Common metrics to measure inference performance, like time-to-first-token and token-per-second.\r\n\r\n**Context and batch size** (5 min) Adds to the picture the sequence length, as well as the number of requests to process in parallel.

Thanks to a mature ML framework ecosystem, powered by libraries like PyTorch and JAX, AD performs remarkably well at a component level; however, integrating these components into differentiable pipelines still remains a significant challenge. In this talk, we will provide an accessible introduction to (pipeline-level) AD, demonstrate some cool applications you can build with it, and see how to build differentiable pipelines that hold up in the real world.",
            "description": "The tools enabling automatic differentiation (AD), like JAX and PyTorch, are increasingly being adopted beyond machine learning to tackle optimization problems in various scientific and engineering contexts. These tools have catalyzed the development of differentiable simulators, solvers, 3D renderers, and other powerful components, under the umbrella of differentiable programming (DP).\r\n\r\nHowever, building pipelines that propagate gradients effortlessly across components introduces unique challenges. Real-world pipelines often span diverse technologies, frameworks (e.g., JAX, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Julia), computing environments (local vs. distributed clusters; CPU vs. GPU), and teams with varying expertise. Additionally, legacy systems and non-differentiable components often need to coexist with modern AD-enabled frameworks.\r\n\r\nThis talk will provide an overview of differentiable pipelines: why they matter and the types of optimization problems they address. We will revisit foundational concepts of automatic differentiation to set the stage for understanding the intricacies of orchestrating differentiable pipelines in Python.\r\n\r\nThen, using our open-source project, Tesseract, as a case study, we will share lessons learned and best practices for designing AD-friendly APIs with tools like Pydantic and FastAPI, achieving seamless integration with JAX, packaging scientific software, and enabling end-to-end systems-level optimization. \r\n\r\nAttendees will leave with practical insights on why they should care about differentiable programming, and how to overcome the challenges of building real-world differentiable pipelines.",

Python\u2019s versatile ecosystem makes it an ideal tool for processing, analyzing, and visualizing geospatial data. In this tutorial, we will take a practical, hands-on approach to working with geospatial data using OpenStreetMap (OSM) as a primary data source.\r\n\r\nWe will begin by introducing the Python libraries that form the backbone of geospatial analysis, including osmnx, geopandas, and shapely. Using OpenStreetMap, participants will learn how to extract real-world geographic features such as road networks, points of interest, or land use data. From there, we will dive into cleaning and processing the data, focusing on manipulating geospatial datasets, handling projections, and combining data from multiple sources.\r\n\r\nNext, we will explore spatial analysis techniques, such as calculating distances, finding optimal routes, and performing geoprocessing tasks. By integrating these capabilities, attendees will uncover insights from geospatial data that can be applied to a wide variety of domains.\r\n\r\nFinally, we will visualize our results using both static and interactive maps. Static visualizations will be created with matplotlib and folium, while interactive maps will come to life using kepler.gl and ipyleaflet. Participants will learn how to build engaging visualizations that make their geospatial insights accessible and actionable.\r\n\r\nThroughout the session, we will apply these skills in a real-world case study. Together, we will analyze a city\u2019s infrastructure, mapping elements such as public transportation networks, green spaces, or bike paths. This practical example will demonstrate how geospatial data can inform decision-making and foster better understanding of our physical environment.\r\n\r\nThis tutorial is ideal for Python developers, data scientists, and GIS enthusiasts who want to get started with geospatial programming.

Overcoming Challenges as a Woman from a Marginalized Community:**\r\nPersonal Struggles: Share your own background, the challenges you faced as a woman from a marginalized community, and how these struggles shaped your perspective on opportunities. Discuss how, in some environments, women are expected to fit into certain molds, often limiting their choices and aspirations.\r\n\"Growing up in a marginalized community, I had to fight for basic respect and recognition. Doors were often closed for women like me\u2014doors to opportunities, to career advancement, to being heard. The idea of \u2018success\u2019 felt distant, something only achievable by a select few, and for women like me, it seemed out of reach.\"\r\nI felt stuck between societal expectations and my desire to make a mark in the world.\"\r\n\r\n**2. Finding Empowerment Through a Women's University:**\r\nWhen I decided to attend a women\u2019s university, I was looking for a safe space where I could focus on learning and growing. What I didn\u2019t anticipate was how transformative this experience would be. At this university, I wasn\u2019t just learning theory or gaining academic knowledge. I was learning to be unapologetically myself, to pursue my passions, and to embrace leadership without fear of being judged or minimized.\"\r\n\r\nImportance of Sisterhood:\r\n\"The most powerful thing I found at the university wasn\u2019t just the curriculum\u2014it was the support from my peers. We pushed each other, celebrated each other\u2019s victories, and helped one another when the path became difficult. This sense of community and shared understanding gave me the strength to keep moving forward.\"\r\n\r\n**3. Discovering Tech Communities: Python and Pyladies:**\r\n\"As I progressed in my academic journey, I started exploring new career avenues. Technology, with its promise of innovation and problem-solving, drew me in. But being a woman in a male-dominated field felt intimidating, so I knew I had to find a supportive network to help me grow.\"\r\n***How Python and Pyladies Became Key in Your Journey:***\r\n\"Python, with its welcoming and inclusive culture, became a place where I could develop the technical skills I needed. But it was Pyladies\u2014an incredible community of women in tech\u2014that really made the difference. Being part of Pyladies gave me more than just coding skills; it gave me a sense of belonging, a community where women uplifted one another and shared knowledge without judgment.\"\r\nThe Power of Mentorship and Networking: Reflect on how interacting with other women in tech, through events, workshops, and meetups, helped you grow both personally and professionally. Share a story or example of a mentor or peer who had a significant impact on you.\r\n\r\n\"In Pyladies, I found mentors who not only taught me technical skills but also helped me understand the importance of confidence, persistence, and resilience in a competitive industry. One of the most impactful moments was when a mentor\u2014someone who had been in the industry for years\u2014told me, 'You belong here.' That simple affirmation changed everything for me.\"\r\n\r\n**4. Developing the Right Skills, Attitude, and Confidence:**\r\nBut what I didn\u2019t anticipate was the confidence I would gain, not just in my coding abilities but in my ability to tackle challenges, no matter how complex.\"\r\n\r\n\"One of the biggest lessons I learned was that failure is not something to fear but something to embrace as part of the journey. Through these communities, I learned to see challenges as opportunities to learn, and I built an attitude of perseverance and continuous self-improvement.\"\r\n\r\n**5. Finding the Right Job and Advancing in Life:**\r\n\"With the support and mentorship I received, I finally found the courage to choose a job that aligned with my passion for technology and my desire to make an impact. I wasn\u2019t just looking for any job; I wanted to find something that felt meaningful, where my contributions mattered.\"\r\nCareer Progression and Self-Advocacy: Reflect on how you began advocating for yourself more confidently in the workplace, using the skills and mindset you developed from your communities.\r\n\r\n\"When I started my career, I realized that advocating for myself was just as important as the technical work I was doing. Thanks to my experience in these communities, I understood the importance of speaking up, setting boundaries, and pursuing opportunities that aligned with my goals.\"\r\nConclusion:\r\n\r\nA Message of Empowerment: Close by sharing a message of empowerment to the women in the audience. Remind them that no matter where they come from or what challenges they face, they have the ability to succeed, especially when they find the right communities and the right support.\r\n\r\n\"To every woman out there facing uncertainty or feeling limited by circumstances\u2014know that you are not alone. There are communities out there that will embrace you, uplift you, and empower you. Find them, lean on them, and use them as the foundation to build the career and life you deserve. Together, we can achieve so much more than we ever could alone.\"\r\nEnd with a Call to Action: Invite the audience to take action by joining communities, seeking mentorship, and supporting one another.",

In this session, we\u2019ll explore how to integrate Typer with Terraform to manage resources that fall outside Terraform\u2019s direct purview. We\u2019ll share a real-life example of how Typer was used alongside Terraform to automate and streamline the management of an otherwise unsupported API.

            "description": "Many LLM use cases in the \"real world\" require structured outputs like JSON, for example, extracting information from multiple sources. This is especially important for continuously testing and evaluating your LLM's output, before and during production. Unfortunately, the default output of LLMs is typically unstructured.\r\n\r\nTo receive structured responses, the library 'Instructor' offers tools to ensure structured outputs from your LLM and to evaluate them. In this talk, we will explore the Instructor library based on Pydantic and the OpenAI API for obtaining structured LLM outputs that are easily testable and improve the debugging handling of our LLM application. We will explore the advantages and capabilities of Instructor in a real scenario: using an OpenAI GPT model to extract and summarize data from a ticket system. Based on this use case, we will learn about three main tools of Instructor: \r\n\r\n1. Function calling: OpenAI's function calling allows LLMs to use user-defined functions to solve a task and thereby create a specific, structured output. In instructor, OpenAI's function calling is combined with Pydantic. Instructor makes it easy to use function calling. Explore Instructors features to simplify function calling, and the related advantages in creating robust, structured LLM outputs. \r\n\r\n2. Validators: Validators are provided by Instructor to evaluate the output of an LLM and reprompt it if the evaluation fails. We will see how to create validators and examine specific use cases related to the ticket system. Furthermore, we will explore different types of validators and how they support us in creating a testable LLM system.\r\n\r\n3. Hooks: Instructor provides pre- and post-execution hooks that are triggered at specific events. We will dive into the concept of pre- and post-execution hooks and explore their capabilities for evaluating the LLM's output. We will see how to implement these hooks for transparency of the LLM's output, ensuring easy logging and debugging.\r\n\r\nAfter this talk, you will have an overview of Instructor's tools, how they can help you let your LLM generate structured outputs, and how you can use Instructor for testing and evaluating your LLM's output.",

            "description": "Not all geospatial data are best represented using a projected coordinate system. Unfortunately, the Python geospatial ecosystem is almost fully based on planar geometries using Shapely, and is still lacking a general purpose library for efficient manipulation of geometric objects on the sphere. We introduce Spherely: a new Python library that fills this gap, aiming to provide a similar API as Shapely, but then gor geometries on the sphere.\r\n\r\nSpherely provides Python/Numpy vectorized bindings to S2Geometry, a mature and performant C++ library for spherical geometry that is widely used for indexing and processing geographic data, notably in popular database systems. This is done via S2Geography, a C++ library that has emerged from the R-spatial ecosystem and that provides a GEOS-like compatibility layer on top of S2Geometry. Unlike S2Geometry\u2019s SWIG wrappers or S2Sphere (pure-Python implementation), Spherely exposes its functionality via \u201cuniversal\u201d functions operating on n-dimensional Numpy arrays, therefore greatly reducing the overhead of the Python interpreter.\r\n\r\nComplementary to Shapely 2.0, Spherely may be used as a backend geometry engine for Python geospatial libraries like GeoPandas, hence extending their functionality to more robust and accurate manipulation of geographic data (i.e., using longitude and latitude coordinates).\r\n\r\nThis presentation introduces spherely and its capabilities to work with vector geometries on the sphere, and its integration into GeoPandas.\r\n\r\nCode repository: https://github.com/benbovy/spherely",

            "description": "In natural disaster scenarios, effective coordination of relief efforts is essential, especially when traditional communication networks are compromised or overloaded. This involves organizing various aspects of disaster response without internet connectivity, such as dike defense, sandbag logistics, power supply, distribution of relief goods, clearing and repairing roadways, searching for missing persons, securing structurally unstable buildings and salvaging property. Typically, emergency responders are mobilized from different regions and may not be familiar with the affected area. Since it is unlikely that responders will have pre-downloaded offline maps of the target region on their devices, a vehicle-hosted Wi-Fi hotspot providing nationwide maps would be invaluable.

Or, in other words, how multimodal models can go beyond trivial reverse engineering by decomposing tables into its building blocks, in plain language, as how those would be explained to another human; or better yet, as how humans would ask questions about such pieces of knowledge. Consequently, it brings robustness to retrieval, the backbone of RAG.

            "description": "Introduction: Django framework has revolutionized web development in the IT sector globally. It has gained widespread acceptance and usage by many developers due to its versatility and scalability. Particularly documentation on Django has provided the users a know-how of the technology and its applications from beginners to the advanced professionals. Problem: There seems to be a problematic area that needs to be addressed with a solution. The problem is that there is certain information scarcity with respect to emerging areas like NLP (Natural Language Processing) and its integration with Django. Although this integration concept has been introduced several years ago, it still requires input in terms of practical feasibility in real life scenarios like healthcare domain. There seems to be knowledge deficit problem in this area. \r\nBody:\r\nNLP refers to an Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology that enables computers understand and process natural languages in spoken or text form. Especially, NLP has several facets with regard to the processing of large amounts of text or data. For instance, information extraction (IE) in NLP is  key technology that automatically extracts structured data from unstructured data. It can recognize and pull out particular data like dates, names, relationships and many more and organizes them. ORM(object relational mapping)  tables when used in Django could generate tabular data, say, patient data in this case. But this tabular data, needs some integration with analytical tool to organize them for a quick analysis.\r\nRelevance of the problem to the audience:\r\nThe problem is relevant to audience or the IT community because they need approaches that can lessen the complexity involved in extraction ad analysis of large datasets from a database. This in turn can help them in better organization, planning and decision making.\r\nSolution to the problem:\r\nThe solution to the problem is building and training a NLP model, developing  a Django view for NLP Integration, using NLP libraries like TextBlob, Textacy, NLTK etc  to process the input text data(patient data, for example).Then install needed Django libraries, create ORM, views or APIs for processing data input , running NLP tasks for recognizing  and classifying named entities, and obtain the final output in the form of template.\r\n\r\nConclusion/ takeaway:\r\nDjango-NLP integration is an emerging field with regard to processing and extraction of large datasets particularly when dealing with public databases like patient data in hospitals. This approach may serve a solution for handling AI (Artificial Intelligence) based  large dataset handling. This can guide the doctors to come up with better diagnosis and treatment plans. This approach of cross talk between Django tabular data and NLP may  guide the data scientists  for exploratory data analysis (EDA) in Machine learning.",

            "description": "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a model architecture for tasks requiring information retrieval from large corpora combined with generative models to fulfil a user information need. It's typically used for question-answering, fact-checking, summarization, and information discovery. \r\n\r\nThe RAG process consists: indexing, which converts textual data into searchable formats; retrieval, which selects relevant documents for a query using different methods; and augmentation, which feeds retrieved information and the user's query into a Large Language Model (LLM) via a prompt for output generation.\r\n\r\nTypically, one has little control over the augmentation step besides what's provided to the LLM via the prompt and a few parameters, like the maximum length of the generated text or the temperature of the sampling process. On the other hand, the indexing and retrieval steps are more flexible and can be customized to the specific needs of the task or the data.\r\n\r\nMy talk will focus on RAG systems' indexing and retrieval techniques. Attendees will learn about various methods, starting with classical approaches rooted in the Information Retrieval community. While these methods have been around for decades, they remain widely used today due to their simplicity and efficiency.\r\n\r\nThe session will then explore more modern techniques that leverage LLMs to enhance the indexing process or optimize user queries. These approaches aim to improve the retrieval of relevant documents and improve the performance of RAG systems.\r\n\r\nParticipants will gain insights into each technique's unique features, advantages, and limitations, along with guidance on selecting the most appropriate approach for specific tasks and datasets. The talk will conclude with a performance analysis, comparing these techniques on an annotated dataset. Key metrics such as speed, accuracy, and efficiency will be evaluated, offering a comprehensive understanding of the trade-offs and practical takeaways for real-world applications.",

In this tutorial, we\u2019ll explore how to build and deploy a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application using Docker. RAG applications combine data retrieval with generative AI to produce contextually relevant and accurate responses, making them powerful tools for interactive Q&A systems.\r\n\r\nWe will build a document-based Q&A application that allows users to upload files, retrieve context from them, and answer questions interactively. We will use LlamaIndex to build the RAG pipeline and use both open-source LLM from Groq and closed-source LLM, such as OpenAI models, for LLM access. This tutorial will guide you through the entire lifecycle\u2014from building the app to deploying it using Docker on Hugging Face Spaces. Whether you\u2019re new to Docker or experienced with RAG, this guide offers a hands-on approach to deploying scalable and efficient AI solutions.",
            "description": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications are reshaping AI by combining real-time data retrieval with large language models to generate accurate, dynamic, and context-aware responses. This tutorial provides a comprehensive, step-by-step guide to building and deploying a RAG application using Docker. Attendees will learn how to create portable and consistent environments that simplify deployment, ensure compatibility, and streamline operations for RAG workflows.\r\n\r\nThe tutorial will begin with Setting Up the Environment, including installing Docker, creating a project directory, and managing API keys securely with .env files. Next, attendees will learn how to Build the RAG Application by writing Python scripts to integrate file parsing, embedding generation, and querying LLMs. We will also implement key functions for handling uploaded files, generating context-aware responses, and creating a Gradio-based user interface for seamless interaction.\r\nIn the Creating the Dockerfile section, attendees will package the application into a Docker image by writing a Dockerfile to automate setup and expose the application interface. This is followed by Building and Running the Docker Image, where participants will learn to test the application locally by running it as a Docker container, using Docker commands to manage and troubleshoot the setup.\r\n\r\nThe tutorial will then cover Deploying to Hugging Face Spaces, a beginner-friendly cloud platform for hosting Docker-based applications. We will demonstrate how to set up a Hugging Face Space, configure API key secrets, and automate the deployment process for the RAG application. Finally, attendees will learn best practices for Monitoring and Optimizing the Application. The session will also include tips for optimizing Docker configurations to reduce image size and improve performance.\r\n\r\nThis tutorial is tailored for developers, data scientists, and ML engineers interested in deploying scalable and efficient RAG applications. Whether you're new to Docker or have experience with LLM-based workflows, this guide offers actionable insights and practical skills to streamline deployment processes. By the end of the session, participants will have a fully functional RAG application running in the cloud and the confidence to deploy similar solutions across various environments.",

Faced with the challenge of developing a fast and flexible solution in just a few months, we leveraged Dash as a low-code application framework and Polars as a powerful data manipulation library.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ll begin by setting the context for strategic demand forecasting in the automotive industry, highlighting unique challenges due to the long forecasting horizons. Next, we\u2019ll introduce two key planning paradigms: cause-and-effect oriented versus outcome-oriented planning, and how they shaped our approach.\r\n\r\nOur solution broke away from conventional tools like classic JavaScript/React frontends and database-centric architectures. Instead, we used Dash and Dash Mantine Components to streamline the development of a polished, interactive application, and Polars to deliver a lightweight yet feature-rich alternative to traditional DBMS setups for manipulating planning data.\r\n\r\nWhile forecasting algorithms remain outside the scope of this session, we\u2019ll focus on lessons learned during the development process\u2014what worked, what didn\u2019t, and how these tools impacted our speed, ability to deliver features, and team experience.\r\n\r\nThe techniques and tools discussed in this talk can benefit not only the automotive industry but any domain that requires strategic planning for long horizons.\r\n\r\nAttendees will leave with actionable insights into leveraging Dash and Polars for building fast, flexible planning applications, along with practical advice for navigating similar projects.",

To prevent these disruptions, engineering teams rely on various tools and practices to address unexpected system behavior. In today\u2019s distributed world, applications are often segmented into microservices to improve agility and performance. This also brings added complexity, with more opportunities for things to go wrong - errors, latency and more. In this dynamic landscape, observability has evolved from a mere buzzword into a crucial approach for modern reliable systems. We initially gravitate towards a tool for its ease of use, but later after investing significant amount of time and finances, if we choose to migrate, vendor lock-in becomes a major concern. This is where the importance of open standards like OpenTelemetry become essential.\r\n\r\nWhile many think of observability as solely an issue for SREs, but it\u2019s increasingly a developer concern. During this session, we\u2019ll explore why observability matters and how it is evolved over the years. We'll cover how to instrument Python code, process telemetry data and export it seamlessly for analysis. Attendees will leave with a clearer understanding of how observability increases confidence in managing complex systems and how adopting open standards improve the overall developer experience.

This year, however, feels uniquely special. I\u2019m not just learning; I\u2019m contributing, sharing insights on a topic I\u2019ve immersed myself in - how observability tools directly impact application performance and sustainability.\r\n\r\nIn 2022, I worked on a critical research project focused on observability. Our team faced a budget crunch that demanded creative solutions. That\u2019s when I discovered OpenTelemetry. My journey with it began as a curious learner, evolved into open-source contributions, and recently culminated in helping design the CNCF certification for the OpenTelemetry Certified Associate. This hands-on experience has given me a nuanced understanding of the tool, its challenges, and its transformative potential.\r\n\r\nWhat sets this talk apart is its developer-centric perspective. While I\u2019ve shared my thoughts on OpenTelemetry in DevOps and platform-focused settings, this time I\u2019ll speak directly to developers -the ones who often feel the impact of sweeping tool migrations. I\u2019ll share lessons learned from my team\u2019s mistakes and triumphs over the past two years, offering practical advice on adopting OpenTelemetry at scale.\r\n\r\nThis isn\u2019t just about metrics or traces.

However, their **non-deterministic nature** means that their behaviour cannot be fully predicted or tested before deployment. This makes **observability** an essential practice for building and maintaining applications with generative AI features.\r\n\r\nThis session focuses on observability in LLM-based systems.\r\n\r\nWe start by motivating why monitoring and understanding your application is key to ensuring quality, reliability, and scalability. We\u2019ll analyze three leading tools for observability in this domain: **Langfuse**, **OpenLIT**, and **Phoenix**. Each has unique strengths and challenges that make them suitable for different use cases.\r\n\r\nThrough examples and real-world scenarios, we\u2019ll explore:\r\n\r\n- How **Langfuse** provides detailed tracing and quality monitoring through developer-friendly APIs. While it supports multi-step workflows effectively, it lacks support for the OpenTelemetry protocol and can be difficult to customize for non-standard use cases.\r\n- Why **OpenLIT**, built on OpenTelemetry, offers strong observability for distributed systems. Although it is the least mature of the three tools, it integrates well with established observability stacks and has promising potential for future growth.\r\n- Where **Phoenix** fits into the process by combining experimentation and debugging capabilities with evaluation pipelines. Its strength lies in development-focused observability, but it has limitations in handling real-time tracing once systems are in production.\r\n\r\nThis talk will provide a clear, straightforward comparison of these tools, helping you understand which option best fits your LLM applications.\r\n\r\nYou\u2019ll leave with practical insights into how observability can enhance the reliability and performance of your generative AI systems.",

            "description": "Machine learning models often perpetuate biases that exacerbate societal inequities, particularly for vulnerable groups. As machine learning increasingly shapes critical decisions, addressing these biases is more important than ever. In this talk, I will explain how Bayesian methods offer a principled and effective approach to improving fairness by directly addressing bias and incorporating uncertainty into machine learning models.\u2028\r\n\r\nThe talk will cover:\r\n\r\n1.\tTheoretical Foundations: I will start by exploring the connection between Bayesian statistics, fairness, and accuracy, with a focus on why uncertainty is a crucial factor in fairness interventions.\r\n2.\tPractical Example: Using a risk-scoring model trained on a dataset with underrepresented minority groups, I will demonstrate how Bayesian methods compare to traditional fairness techniques. This example will illustrate their ability to not only mitigate bias but also adapt to complex, real-world data distributions while maintaining predictive accuracy.\r\n3.\tKey Insights and Applications: Finally, I will provide actionable takeaways on incorporating Bayesian thinking into existing workflows, enabling more equitable and robust outcomes across diverse applications.\u2028\r\n\r\nThis talk is designed to be accessible to a broad audience. While minimal familiarity with machine learning concepts and fairness principles is recommended, no advanced knowledge of statistics is required. Attendees will leave with practical tools, code examples, and insights to address bias effectively in real-world scenarios, empowering them to promote fairness in their own projects and organizations.",

This talk presents a practical PoC that tackles this challenge head-on, utilizing SAP Datasphere as the key integration point.\r\n\r\nOutline:\r\n\r\n1. The challenge: navigating sap's data silos and the pursuit of a unified view\r\n* The section outlines the enterprise data landscape of RATIONAL where valuable master data resides within SAP\u2019s traditionally closed ecosystem, hindering data democratization and the creation of a comprehensive, 360\u00b0 operational view. This scenario is quite common - at least for German manufacturing companies. This situation is frequently encountered, particularly among German manufacturers.\r\n* The inherent conflict between the open, distributed nature of data lakes (especially those built on data mesh principles) and the centralized, closed nature of traditional SAP BI environments is discussed.\r\n\r\n2. Solution overview: leveraging sap datasphere as the integration layer\r\n* An introduction to sap datasphere and its capabilities is provided, with a focus on its ability to connect with non-SAP systems.\r\n* This part explains how datasphere was chosen as the central integration layer for the proof of concept and its role in enabling bi-directional data flow between SAP and the open data lake.\r\n\r\n3. Architecture of SAP Datasphere\r\n* Introduction in architecture of SAP Datasphere and role of underlying SAP HANA database\r\n* Explanation of openSQL schema as key integration option\r\n\r\n4. Security first: exploring network integration, authentication and authorization options\r\n* This section details the evaluation of network connectivity options between the Azure services like Azure Databricks, PostgresQL, ADLS and SAP Datasphere\r\n* The methods used to authenticate Python and Pypark to SAP datasphere are explained\r\n* The implementation and evaluation of data authorization mechanisms within SAP Datasphere are described\r\n\r\n5. Python and PySpark integration\r\n* Available interfaces for python integration (ODBC/JDBC, OData), their features and limitations\r\n* Explanation of practical data integration patterns implemented within the poc for extracting data from sap and loading it into the data lake for full and delta load scenarios\r\n\r\n5. Reflecting PoC: summary and key learnings\r\n* This section summarizes the core findings and lessons learned from the PoC, particularly regarding security and software quality best practices\r\n* A hint for the SAP open data alliance launched in 2023\r\n\r\nMain takeaways:\r\n* An understanding of SAP Datasphere's architecture and its potential for integrating non-SAP, open-source technologies like Python and PySpark\r\n* Knowledge of current features and limitations of SAP Datasphere in the area of data integration with the open source world",

Motivation:\r\nIn this section we introduce personalized medicine, focus on challenges for disease course forecasting and introduce the specific challenges for antibiotic selection in Sepsis patients.\r\nOur research is focused on Electronic Health Records data. Typical challenges are: Very irregular data, a mixture of time-dependent and static variables and assimilating updated laboratory value measurements. \r\nSepsis is a severe dysregulation of the immune system, damaging own healthy tissue and organs. The choice of an initial antibiotic is challenging, because pathogen identification often lasts two days and in 30% to 70% of patients no pathogen can be detected at all. Consequently, treatment recommendations focus on broad-spectrum antibiotics, with little attention paid to side-effects.\r\n\r\n2. OptAB (Methods and implementation).\r\nThis section introduces OptAB, a data-driven online-updateable antibiotic selection model based on Artificial Intelligence for Sepsis patients considering side-effects. OptAB performs an iterative optimal antibiotic selection for real-world Sepsis patients aimed at minimizing the Sepsis-related organ failure score (SOFA-Score) as treatment success while accounting for nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity as serious antibiotic side-effects. We trained OptAB on the MIMIC-IV dataset, a a large deidentified dataset of patients admitted to the emergency department or an intensive care unit at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston (https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/3.1/). We focus on the antibiotics Vancomycin, Piperacillin/Tazobactam and Ceftriaxone. OptAB is implemented using PyTorch and torchcde. \r\n\r\n3. Results\r\nIn this section we will present the results of OptAB in the MIMIC-IV testdataset and an external testdataset from AmsterdamUMCdb. First, we present heatmaps of the disease course forecasts. Then, we provide evidence, that OptAB learns realistic treatment effects. OptAB's treatment recommendations lead to a faster reduction in SOFA-Score that the factual administered treatment and OptAB is able to prevent antibiotic-induced Acute Kidney Injury. Finally, we illustrate OptAB on one or two example patients.\r\n\r\n4. Conclusion\r\nThis section summarizes the main results, limitations and outlook for OptAB. Future work will focus on uncertainty quantification and enhancing interpretability of OptAB.\r\n\r\n5. References",

            "description": "Outline\r\n--------\r\n\r\nIn a professional industry environment, each new Python development project in the context of data engineering and data science requires an initial setup to ensure a solid scaffolding that supports common company standards, software engineering best practices and recurrent requirements. This becomes even more important in bigger organizations with security concerns, multiple departments and an increasing number of developers and scientists. By providing a solid project base you can avoid redundant work, unsynchronized technology stacks and configurations. Furthermore, spending effort on the standardization and simplification of the overall process allows to save time and money for all future projects.\r\n\r\nOur proposed talk will focus on the following aspects of the challenge described.\r\n\r\n-\tWhy do you need a common scaffolding for Python data projects?\r\n-\tRequirements we considered during our solution development\r\n-\tPossible solutions and alternatives\r\n-\tOur implemented approach\r\n-\tHow can you use or adapt our approach for your environment?\r\n\r\nIn the following, we provide some details for each of the planned sections.\r\n\r\nWhy do you need a common scaffolding for Python data projects?\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nAs an organization, you want your development force to be focused on actual development and value generation as much as possible by avoiding repetitive and distracting work while also keeping high engineering and security standards. \r\n\r\nDevelopers often work in multiple team constellations in parallel and need to switch between them frequently, especially in project-based businesses. Using a unified technology stack and structure across all projects significantly reduces the mental overhead for this switching process.\r\nA common scaffolding for Python projects also provides an explicit place to have discussions about standards and best-practices. It eliminates the need to have lengthy discussions at the start of every project by providing reasonable defaults for project structure and tooling, while still giving teams the freedom to modify these defaults on a per project basis, if needed.\r\n\r\nRequirements we considered during our solution development\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nBefore we started to develop a particular approach, we collected process steps within our development lifecycle with potential for standardization as well as steps that occurred regularly during project setup and development.\r\n\r\nDevelopment lifecycle steps in our organization with high standardization potential were:\r\n- Choose a project structure\r\n- Select a dependency management tool\r\n- Setup the usual dependencies we use in projects\r\n- Setup testing\r\n- Setup linting, type checking and auto-formatting\r\n- Setup CI/CD\r\n- Write meaningful and standardized conventional commit messages\r\n- Implement a basic container image\r\n- Setup a data pipeline\r\n\r\nOur goal is to automate as many items from that list as possible and make the remaining as easy as possible. Moreover, it should be possible to propagate changes made to the standard to already existing projects using those standards and to allow for a set of common standards as well as task or project-specific standards, such as containerized images.\r\n\r\nPossible solutions and alternatives\r\n-------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThere are different options to avoid recurring efforts of setting-up a new Python project. \r\nA simple approach could be to work with mono repos, but they have several major drawbacks such as unnecessary coupling of code, conflicting dependencies and a general risk of losing proper project structure due to masses of files and folders. This is also generally challenging for organizations working for different clients, due to unwanted code sharing and other security concerns.\r\n\r\nAn alternative method to minimize setup time involves duplicating and pasting existing projects. Though feasible, this method also presents challenges such as unintentional copying of project-specific code that may compromise security. Additionally, configurations tailored to the original project might be overlooked, requiring adjustments, and documentation may not be updated for the new project. Like the mono-repo approach, it's difficult to uniformly implement changes in standards across duplicated projects.\r\n\r\nA third option is to use templates which set up the basic desired structure of the project, provide an environment setup and whatever additional tooling is desired as standard. Given the right tooling, they also allow to propagate changes to the template to already existing projects.\r\n\r\nOur approach\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nThe solution that we recommend is to rely on one or more project templates in connection with a rendering application that allows for updating existing projects and chaining of templates. \r\nWe provide a base template for elements which we assume to be universal across all Python projects in our organization. We also provide additional templates for specialized aspects which are not needed in every project. These templates can be applied after the base template and do not contain any duplicate information compared with the base template.\r\nIn our case, we decided to use copier as templating engine and self-developed Jinja-based project templates. copier  instantiates a new project off one or more templates and additionally connects the new project to the template project(s), so that later updates on the template can be pulled into the instantiated projects.\r\nThe choice of copier as engine allows also to chain templates after each other, which we use to enhance a very general-purpose base template with additional features which are commonly needed within dedicated teams, such as data engineering or data science teams. We show how we implemented this template chaining using git subprojects, jinja statements and renovate.\r\nOne example of such a chained template is the creation of a container image, which is needed in a lot of projects, but not all. Instead of setting up a Dockerfile within the base template, we built another template that sits on top of the base referencing it instead of duplicating the code base.  Another example would be the setup of an ETL pipeline, which is standardized within our data engineering team, but not needed in projects without data pipelines.\r\nThe core of our approach is the department wide base template. It ships with a basic Python project structure, several provisioned module files as well as tooling and corresponding configuration to streamline development, such as\r\n\r\n- \u2018poethepoet\u2019 for running tasks\r\n- \u2018uv\u2019 for managing python versions, dependencies and virtual environments\r\n- \u2018ruff\u2019 for linting and auto-reformatting\r\n- \u2018mypy\u2019 for type checking\r\n- \u2018bandit\u2019 for vulnerability and security checks\r\n- Reasonable default configurations for ruff, mypy, and bandit\r\n- \u2018pytest\u2019 as testing tool\r\n- \u2018pre-commit\u2019 for easy integration of pre-commit hooks\r\n    -\tThe hooks are setup to automatically conduct a variety of checks before an actual commit, such as unit tests, type checks, and formatting\r\n- \u2018commitizen\u2019 for easy creation of conventional commits\r\n\r\nWorking exclusively in Gitlab, we also incorporated some basic CI/CD, that serves as a starting point for more project specific pipelines and already includes linting, testing, and format checks, corresponding to the steps defined as pre-commit hooks.\r\nFinally, the template includes a README whith (templated) instructions about project setup, usage and general structure for the additional documentation developers should provide while developing the project.\r\nThe base template has been put together to ensure that developers can get to development as fast as possible and focus on it. Virtual environment setup, reasonable initial dependencies, testing setup, enforcement of formatting and even the generation of standardized commit messages are prepared automatically. A full setup starting from  an empty project folder takes less than 4 minutes before the first commit and unit test compared to up to at least one hour without any templates.\r\n\r\nHow can you use or adapt our approach for your environment?\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nUsage of the shown approach is very simple and will be demonstrated live in our talk.\r\nApart from installing the tools copier, uv, and poethepoet only a single copier command is necessary to bootstrap a new project from the template and only one additional copier command for each chained template.\r\nCreating a new template with additional features is also very straightforward by including upstream templates as git subprojects. New files that do not exist in the upstream template(s) (e.g. the base template) can just be templated via jinja. Files already existing in an upstream template can easily be amended with the usage of jinjas \u201cinclude\u201d statement.\r\nWe are planning to release our base template under a permissive open-source license, so that it can easily be adjusted to work within other organizations.\r\n\r\nConclusion \r\n------------\r\n\r\nWe present our approach to standardize Python and especially Python data projects and automate recurring tasks during project setups, accommodating diverse team requirements. Our approach also facilitates seamless propagation of changes to these standards to new and existing projects. An added benefit is that this approach implicitly establishes a centralized place for documentation, discussion, and evolution of these standards (namely, the template projects), promoting organization-wide unification of tech stacks and security concerns. Our proposed talk will comprehensively describe the development of our solution, considered requirements, advantages and disadvantages of solution options and conclude with a live demonstration and instruction on how everybody can adapt our approach.",

            "abstract": "A useful way of assessing the quality of probabilistic demand forecasts is to compare their performance to that of a theoretically best-possible limit. This theoretical limit can often be found by determining an upper bound to the forecast sharpness, which, in turn, sets a (not-always-achievable) lower bound for the error metrics. In retail, for example, the sharpness limit is typically given by the Poisson distribution. However, there are certain higher order effects that can make the real-world demand deviate from this ideal behavior, making the Poisson limit not always useful as a forecast quality benchmark. A common example of this occurs when the actual sales are constrained by the available stocks, which leads to a right censoring of the demand distribution. In this contribution, we present how to approach this problem as well as the Python-based solution developed at Blue Yonder for enabling adequate forecast quality assessment even in complex scenarios with constrained demand.",
            "description": "This talk will present a statistical approach for evaluating the quality of probabilistic demand forecasts without falling into typical traps, and how this approach needs to be adapted to include complex scenarios such as finite capacity (i.e., when the demand is constrained by stocks).

As organizations increasingly rely on AI models to identify and manage such risks in their security systems, a critical question arises: how can we be sure these systems are making the right decisions, especially when the stakes are high? Imagine your AI system flags a critical vulnerability in your code. But why? What specific patterns triggered the alert or ensured that other potentially more critical vulnerabilities haven\u2019t been overlooked? Traditional AI models in security often operate as \u2018black boxes,\u2019 providing alerts without clear explanations. This lack of transparency hinders incident response, makes it difficult to fine-tune systems, and erodes trust in AI-driven security solutions. Without understanding the \u201cwhy,\u201d can we truly trust the system to remediate the issue?

This opacity makes it difficult for security teams to understand why a vulnerability was flagged, validate the findings, efficiently address the root cause, and ultimately trust the AI\u2019s output. So, the audience will understand that the \u201cblack box\u201d problem in AI security is a significant roadblock to the trust and security of the system. \r\n\r\n2) XAI techniques shed light on the decision-making process of the AI models, revealing the factors and the patterns that influence their outputs. By understanding the \u201cwhy\u201d behind the AI-generated alerts, the audience will gain confidence in their systems, learn strategies to improve the incident response, fine-tune the models for better accuracy, and address underlying security issues more effectively. \r\n\r\n3) The audience will gain practical knowledge and insights into using XAI techniques to build transparent, trustworthy, and resilient AI-driven security systems.

I've seen teams really accelerate when we were sharing code. This demands a safe environment where people feel comfortable sharing mistakes and learning from them. This presentation is about my experiences with founding a Python guild and how we got to a higher level of Python and PySpark skills together.",
            "description": "It all started three years ago when Python and PySpark began gaining popularity at my workplace. I noticed significant differences in the skill levels across teams. Some teams were highly experienced, while others were eager to get started but didn\u2019t quite know how. That\u2019s when I proposed starting a Python and PySpark guild \u2014 and so began an incredible journey.\r\nBringing developers together was a solid first step. People shared their screens, showcasing how they used VS Code, created Dockerized Python solutions, and tackled other technical challenges. However, it became clear that not every team could replicate these solutions. While anyone can start writing Python, mastering concepts like virtual environments, testing, and logging required deeper understanding. It didn\u2019t help that experienced and inexperienced developers often spoke different \"technical languages.\"\r\nThe urgency for action became even clearer as the organization\u2019s reliance on Python grew. Two major new customers brought in a flood of work, increasing the need for developer maturity. Recognizing this, I decided to try a different approach: I organized a shared coding session. In this session, less experienced teams worked together to create a PySpark program, with experienced developers present to offer guidance and feedback.\r\nThat approach made a big difference. Gaps in knowledge became immediately visible, and experienced developers started creating solutions that made it easier for less experienced teams to get started. This shift sparked a culture of collaboration and continuous improvement.\r\nAnd the best part? I\u2019m not a manager, scrum master, or team lead. I\u2019m a senior data engineer. But you don\u2019t need to be a manager to start a guild and help teams level up together.",

            "description": "Zarr is a widely adopted, chunked data format designed for efficiently storing large n-dimensional arrays, whether on-disk or in the cloud. Its design focuses on scalability and performance, making it a vital tool for handling massive datasets in fields like machine learning, climate modeling, and biomedical image analysis. The 3.0 release of the zarr-python library represents a major evolution, introducing substantial improvements and new features that enhance its capabilities and maintainability.\r\n\r\n\u2028The 3.0 release introduces support for the latest Zarr specification (version 3), designed to improve interoperability across multiple programming languages and enhance extensibility. One of the most prominent features of this specification is sharding. Sharding enables efficient storage and access to petabyte-scale n-dimensional arrays by allowing multiple chunks to be stored within a single file. This approach optimizes performance on various file systems and object storage services, making it more efficient and scalable for large datasets.\r\n\r\n\u2028The core of the zarr-python library has been reengineered to leverage asynchronous I/O, allowing reads and writes to be performed concurrently. This delivers significant performance improvements, especially when working with high-latency storage systems like object storage. Additionally, the library employs multithreading for encoding and decoding data, further enhancing throughput.\r\n\r\nVersion 3.0 has been redesigned with extensibility in mind, providing developers with the flexibility to integrate custom components such as stores, codecs, buffer classes, and encoding pipelines. This extensibility paves the way for use cases, such as optimized data processing on GPUs.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the codebase has been thoroughly modernized to ensure maintainability and ease of development. The library now has 100% type hint coverage for better code clarity, robustness and code completion. The public and private APIs have been clearly delineated, with the goal of keeping the public APIs stable while evolving the library in the future. Additionally, the development environment has been upgraded with improved CI/CD workflows and testing infrastructure. These updates collectively make zarr-python a modern library that is vital for data-intensive science applications.\r\n\r\nIn my talk, I will provide an introduction to the Zarr format and the zarr-python library, followed by a detailed overview of the major changes introduced in the 3.0 release.",

            "description": "Image generation using AI has made huge progress over the last years, and many people still think that DALL-E with a text prompt is the best way to generate images. But thanks to Stable Diffusion, Flux, and many supplementary models like ControlNet or an Image Prompt Model, we have much more control over the images we want to create. There are frontends for that, like A1111 or Invoke AI, but if you want to try bleeding-edge models or do something more complex, you will have a hard time implementing such a pipeline in code yourself, and it requires a steep learning curve. In this talk, I want to show you ComfyUI, an open-source node-based GUI written in Python where you can build workflows as a DAG. Thanks to many other contributors, there are a lot of plugins available which bring in new functionality. This talk shows the capabilities and power of this tool using practical examples and how you can combine many things together to create a complex workflow much faster than coding it yourself.\r\n\r\nI want to cover the following topics:\r\n - What are the limits of a simple text-to-image workflow?\r\n - What is ComfyUI?\r\n - What are the requirements to use ComfyUI? (Resources, OS, etc.)\r\n - What can you do with ComfyUI that you can't do with a simple text-to-image interface?\r\n   - Pre- and post-processing of images in a single workflow\r\n   - Advanced conditioning using images, bounding boxes, depth maps, etc., all together\r\n - The examples shown as a demonstration:\r\n   - Integrating existing objects from a photo into a generated scenery\r\n   - Creating optical illusions and surreal images",

            "description": "Software development is hard. It's really hard when your organisation's core business isn't _really_ software development.\r\n\r\nHEAnet is a national research network, a nonprofit ISP serving the academic community. We want to fully automate our operational tasks across our network and business. But it's tough. In particular, being a service provider, we fall into a gap in the market. If we were a pure software house, we could probably write our own software to fit our business model. If we were a traditional enterprise, we'd likely have a single hardware vendor and use their platform. We can't really do either - our needs are too custom for a single vendor (not to mention the risk of having all our eggs in one basket).\r\n\r\nSo part of this talk is about the tech. Anna will describe HEAnet's experience in assembling a software stack that meets our needs. She'll spend a little time describing what we use, and why we chose that. This includes tools coming from the NREN community such as [Workflow Orchestrator](https://workfloworchestrator.org)\r\n\r\nCrucial to this is making sure that we are no longer dependent on third party roadmaps that determine how our operations must work, or what features we can provide to our clients. That means we need to get in and write some of this stuff ourselves.\r\n\r\nBut it's still tough. We've had to get out of the \"build vs. buy\" mindset of thinking about a single platform or a loose collection of open source software to meet our needs. The reality is that our businesses today are complex, and managing the automation of our business is itself a complex task that requires its own subject matter experts. It takes a combination of networking, software development, and project management that's pretty unique, and not so easy to hire for or even to outsource.\r\n\r\nSo the talk isn't just about tools \u2013 it's about building the capability to do this. Putting together the right team for the job, learning what's needed to know how to develop the right stack, and deploy it in such a way that we can confidently operate it into the future.\r\n\r\nThe hardest challenge that keeps coming up in the talk isn't really about programming, or choosing tools, or even communicating within the team \u2013 although these are all crucial, and do come up \u2013\u00a0but about making what we do _legible to the rest of the organisation._ How do you operate in an agile way, when all of an organisation's training, the things it's been rewarded for doing, look a lot more like long term, single-goal projects?\r\n\r\nAnna will talk about her experience on a team in exactly this situation, and the lessons she's learned shifting from the role of networker to software developer, via project manager and people manager, to try to get across how the rest of us can make really cool projects happen inside organisations that, at first glance, might have trouble pulling them off.",

Additionally, we will also conduct a short accessibility audit on a website suggested by the audience. This demo will provide a practical understanding of how to improve accessibility.\r\n\r\nWhether you\u2019re a documentation maintainer, a curious developer or simply someone who cares about accessibility, this beginner-friendly talk will help you learn more about accessibility in documentation and how to get started. Love might be a universal language, but your code appreciates accessible documentation.",

            "abstract": "When it comes to open geographic data, [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) (OSM) is an awesome resource. Getting started and figuring out how to make the most out of the data available can be challenging.\r\n\r\nUsing a personal example: frustration at the apparent lack of post offices in my neighborhood, we'll walk through examples of how to parse, filter, process, and visualize geospatial data with Python.\r\n\r\nWhile this talk is aimed at those beginning with geographic data, it would be helpful to have some background knowledge about Python and data handling.\r\n\r\nAt the end of this talk, you will know how to process geographic data from OpenStreetMap using Python and find out some surprising info that I learned while answering the question: _Where have all the post offices gone?_",
            "description": "### Problem statement and brief introduction\r\n4 minutes\r\n\r\n- Needing an international postcard stamp, I headed to my nearest post office only to find out that it was permanently closed, the latest closure among others in recent memory. Was this just in my neighborhood or was this happening all over the state? To answer these questions, I turned to open data and Python.\r\n- What is OpenStreetMap?\r\n\r\n### How can we identify types of places, like post offices and districts, in OSM data?\r\n6 minutes\r\n\r\n- OSM data can be broken down into three elements: nodes, ways and relations.\r\n- Tags are key value pairs which are used to describe an element's features.\r\n- Brief discussion of tools ([Overpass API](https://overpass-api.de/), [overpass turbo](https://overpass-turbo.eu/)) for diving into the data to get an idea of how it is structured and how to construct queries\r\n\r\n### How can we access the raw OSM data and work with it in Python? \r\n8 minutes\r\n\r\nHow many post offices are there in each neighborhood? What about by area or population?\r\n\r\n- We can download data extracts for a region or the entire planet! PBF files are designed to be space efficient, which is important since files for regions, like entire continents, can contain a massive amount of data.\r\n- For parsing and processing the PBF files, we can use the Python library [PyOsmium](https://osmcode.org/pyosmium/). In this step, we'll look at how to create two filters: one for the administrative boundary (district or neighborhood) and another for the facility (post office).\r\n- Use [GeoPandas](https://geopandas.org/) to store the data in a GeoDataFrame. In this step, we'll look at how to approximate the administrative boundary's area in square kilometers and how to determine which post offices are within which boundary area.\r\n\r\n### What are some tools for visualizing the data?\r\n4 minutes\r\n\r\nHow can we make an interactive plot of post offices in each neighborhood? What about other facilities and resources?\r\n\r\n- Plot boundaries directly from a GeoDataFrame\r\n- Use [Bokeh](https://docs.bokeh.org), which supports geographical data with `GeoJSONDataSource`. In this step, all of the pieces will come together in an interactive map of the number of total post offices by neighborhood and the post offices per square kilometer by neighborhood. \r\n\r\n### Summary\r\n3 minutes\r\n\r\n- Review the steps we've taken: parsing and filtering, processing, plotting.\r\n- Brief mention of how we can wire all the pieces together. All the code and resources used in this talk will be available on my public GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Time for questions\r\n5 minutes",

Enter Kuttl. Connecting Kuttl to CI builds has empowered our developers to easily configure a development environment locally that accurately matches the final test environment \u2014 without needing to become an expert CI admin themselves.\r\nThese days, we hear, \u201cWho broke the build?\u201d far less often \u2014 and you can too!",

On the other, small data sets may not yield enough statistical significance to draw meaningful conclusions. Combining these constraints with stakeholder requirements for quick answers from data makes the task of choosing the sample size stopping criterion a challenging balancing act.\r\n\r\nThis is especially true if the data is collected in a sequential manner, where a person, or an algorithm, needs to determine when to stop collecting data to satisfy the project requirements without introducing *confirmation bias*. This has the advantage of potentially reducing costs and time if a significant signal is detected.\r\n\r\nThis talk is targeted to anyone involved in experimentation, technical or managerial, and is interested in improving how they plan an experiment budget and conduct post collection interpretation. A basic understanding of statistics and hypothesis testing are nice-to-haves but not essential as I outline the basics.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation you will learn why even though Bayesian approaches are more reliable than Frequentist ones for small data sets they do not magically solve the problem of confirmation bias in sequential hypothesis testing. This is done by introducing John Kruschke's \u201cPrecision is the Goal\u201d method, where by determining in advance the experiment expected precision level yields unbiassed results. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, I will introduce an improved new approach which enhances practical application.

Ensuring that your model continues to deliver great performance over time is even more critical. In this talk I would like to present a selection of what can kill your model\u2019s performance, zoom in on multivariate data drift, and present two methods to detect this type of drift in your production data.",
            "description": "Objectives: The goal of this talk is to explain what multivariate data drift is and to present methods for detecting it. You will learn about the challenges associated with multivariate drift and explore practical solutions to identify it\r\n\r\n1. Model\u2019s Aren\u2019t Forever: \r\n91% of models in production degrade over time. I will explain the importance of continuous model monitoring and discuss common approaches and pitfalls. \r\n\r\n2. All Ways Your Perfectly Fine ML Model Can Fail: \r\nMachine learning models can fail for numerous reasons. I will describe the root causes of ML model failure, including data quality, data drift and the final boss of every model -  concept drift.\r\nI will explore simple methods to detect univariate data drift and delve into the more complex challenge of concept drift, which can significantly impact your model\u2019s performance in production.\r\n\r\n3. Drift Happens - Multivariate Data Drift: \r\nMultivariate data drift occurs when the relationships between multiple variables in your data change over time. This type of drift can be challenging to detect with standard methods. I will provide an explanation of what multivariate data drift is and why traditional techniques may fall short in identifying it.\r\n\r\n4. Two Clever Ways to Detect Multivariate Data Drift:\r\nDomain Classifier: This method involves training a classifier to distinguish between data from different time periods. If the classifier can accurately separate the data, it indicates that the distribution has changed, signaling potential drift.\r\nPCA Reconstruction Error: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can be used to reduce the dimensionality of your data. By comparing the reconstruction error over time, you can detect changes in the underlying data distribution that may indicate drift.",

            "description": "Software engineering has undergone a profound transformation, and this talk explores the evolution of the role through three critical eras: the past, the present, and the future.  \r\n\r\n**The Past:** Starting with the waterfall model, we\u2019ll examine the early days of software engineering. What role did engineers play in product lifecycles, and how did structured, linear processes shape their work? We\u2019ll briefly discuss the successes and pitfalls of this approach and its influence on engineering practices.  \r\n\r\n**The Present:** The rise of Agile methodologies revolutionized how teams develop software. Engineers today are expected to own the full development cycle\u2014from coding to deployment\u2014while navigating pressures to release quickly and build feature-rich products. We\u2019ll unpack the expertise engineers rely on, their evolving responsibilities, and the challenges they face in balancing rapid delivery with sustainable design.  \r\n\r\n**The Future:** The next stage of software engineering demands a new focus. In an era of constrained resources, teams must emphasize business value above all else. We\u2019ll explore how engineers can support product teams by uncovering actionable insights through data discovery, integrating technical challenges like tech debt into the business cycle, and adopting a holistic understanding of product goals.  \r\n\r\nTo bring these concepts to life, we\u2019ll share the transformation journey of a Django application. We began by establishing anchor features, which helped us identify team strengths and collaboration patterns. From there, we grouped Django apps into logical hierarchies, setting boundaries to foster team alignment and ensure a stable core. Over time, as these structures became difficult to iterate on, we adapted by reversing hierarchies and focusing on flexible \u201ccontact points\u201d to support both team agility and evolving business needs. While pitfalls remain, this approach has helped us remodel apps in response to new challenges, balancing adaptability with stability.  \r\n\r\nThis session offers actionable insights for software engineers seeking to stay ahead of the curve and contribute more strategically to product success.",

However, the ML lifecycle is vulnerable to a range of security threats that can compromise the integrity and accuracy of these models. This talk focuses on the often-overlooked aspects of ML security, specifically the vulnerabilities associated with loading and using model files, pre-trained models and ML Python packages.\r\nWe will begin by exploring the risks and consequences of malicious attacks on these components, including model poisoning and package manipulation. Model poisoning, for example, occurs when an attacker intentionally modifies a model to produce incorrect results, and malicious pre-trained models may execute arbitrary code when loaded. Package manipulation, on the other hand, involves injecting malicious code into popular Python packages used by ML developers.\r\nTo mitigate these threats, we will discuss a range of security measures that can be implemented throughout the ML lifecycle. This includes secure model file formats and verification techniques to detect tampering and ensure authenticity especially for securely loading and using pre-trained models and model artefact scanning when uploading pre-trained or our own models to our model registry. We will also explore the use of package managers and dependency management strategies to prevent malicious package injection.\r\nWe will discuss best practices for implementing these security measures when using popular ML frameworks and libraries, such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn and how we designed workflows to enforce these security measures in our development environment and our productive MLOps platform.\r\nBy highlighting the importance of security in ML and providing actionable guidance, our goal is to enable ML practitioners in the industry to build secure and robust ML systems providing business value.",

A production airflow deployment is a complex piece of engineering, and many common tasks can still be quite difficult to manage. In this talk, we discuss a few Airflow plugins to bridge key gaps and make life easier for engineering and devops alike. In particular, we'll look at plugins for hierarchical central configuration, long-running or \"always on\" jobs, and integration with common alerting services.",
            "description": "Apache Airflow is one of the most popular and widely used schedulers in the world. As we approach the tenth anniversary of its release in June, developement continues to be very active with contributors around the world.\r\n\r\nThere are several common problems that arise in production Airflow deployments. In this talk, we'll discuss three problems and their open source solutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Problem 1: Python\r\n\r\nDynamism and production jobs rarely get along. We adopt the *configuration-as-code* idea by integrating [`hydra`](https://hydra.cc) and [`pydantic`](https://pydantic.dev) to create composeable type-safe configuration, in [`airflow-config`](https://github.com/airflow-laminar/airflow-config). Key features\r\n\r\n- Define DAG- and Task- level configuration in a central location\r\n- Compose configurations for different environments\r\n- Generate DAGs directly from configuration\r\n- Integrate custom Airflow plugins and extensions with type-validated configurations\r\n\r\n#### Problem 2: Long-running Jobs\r\n\r\nAirflow was designed for batch jobs, but with some small tweaks, it also works for long-running or \"always on\" tasks.\r\n\r\n[`airflow-ha`](https://github.com/airflow-laminar/airflow-ha) provides a simple pattern for looping DAGs, and we connect to the popular process monitor [`supervisord`](https://supervisord.org) in [`airflow-supervisor`](https://github.com/airflow-laminar/airflow-supervisor). We can now run high-availability services efficiently without placing undo strain on Airflow from a single DAG.\r\n\r\n#### Problem 3: Alerting\r\n\r\nThe last problem is arguably the most important: alerting when DAGs fail. We have built [`airflow-priority`](https://github.com/airflow-laminar/airflow-priority) on top of the \"priority tag\". Add a `P1`, `P2`, etc, tag to a DAG and failures alerts will propagate to upstream systems like Datadog and New Relic, without any changes to DAG-level code.",

            "description": "AI systems in transportation make decisions that directly impact people's lives, such as route optimization, safety measures, and resource allocation. These decisions often rely on complex algorithms, which can be opaque to stakeholders, including operators, regulators, and passengers. Key ethical concerns include:\r\n\r\n* *Algorithmic Bias*: Models trained on historical data may inadvertently reinforce inequities, such as prioritizing affluent or otherwise preffered neighborhoods over underserved areas.\r\n* *Transparency Deficit*: Operators often cannot understand or explain why an AI system makes a specific decision, leading to mistrust.\r\n* *Lack of Accountability*: In situations where decisions lead to negative outcomes, it is challenging to pinpoint responsibility when the AI acts as a \"black box.\"\r\nThese issues highlight the urgent need for mechanisms to build trust in AI systems, particularly in high-stakes environments like public transportation.\r\n\r\n**The Solution: Explainable AI (XAI)**\r\n\r\nExplainable AI (XAI) refers to methods and tools that make AI systems more transparent by providing interpretable insights into their decision-making processes. By integrating XAI, stakeholders can understand, validate, and trust the outputs of AI systems. Key features of XAI include:\r\n* *Transparency*: Clear explanations of how decisions are made.\r\n* *Accountability*: Mechanisms to trace decisions back to specific data inputs or model parameters.\r\n* *Fairness*: Tools to identify and mitigate bias in data and algorithms.\r\n\r\n\r\n**KARL: A Case Study in XAI for Public Transportation**\r\n\r\nThe *KARL* (KI in Arbeit und Lernen in der Region Karlsruhe) project is an exemplary initiative showcasing how XAI can address ethical challenges in AI-driven transportation. In this project, XAI is integrated into the tram system of Karlsruhe to:\r\n1. *Enhance Problem Handling*: When a tram is delayed, operators receive clear explanations of the underlying causes, such as weather conditions, mechanical failures, or traffic patterns. This enables quicker, more effective interventions.\r\n2. *Build  Trust*: Operators are informed about delays or reroutes in an understandable manner, fostering transparency and trust.\r\n3. *Ensure Fairness*: By analyzing historical data, the system identifies potential biases in route optimization and implements corrective measures to ensure equitable service.\r\n\r\n**Technical Implementation**\r\n\r\nWhile the presentation will not delve deeply into technical specifics, it will touch upon key elements such as:\r\n* The use of open-source libraries like *SHAP* (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to provide interpretability.\r\n* Integration of XAI tools into the operational dashboard used by tram operators.\r\n* Collaboration with domain experts to ensure the explanations are meaningful and actionable.\r\n\r\n**Takeaways for the Audience**\r\n\r\nAt the end of this talk, attendees will:\r\n1. Understand the ethical challenges posed by AI in transportation and how they can undermine trust.\r\n2. Learn how XAI tools can address these challenges by enhancing transparency, accountability, and fairness.\r\n3. Gain insights into the practical implementation of XAI in a real-world setting through the KARL project.\r\n4. Be inspired to incorporate XAI principles into their own AI projects to build ethical and socially responsible solutions.",

Through practical examples, we\u2019ll demonstrate how to write effective tests and extend Robot Framework with custom Python libraries to meet project-specific needs. Walk away with insights and tools to transform how teams communicate, develop, and deliver software.",
            "description": "One of the biggest challenges developers face is dealing with unclear, ambiguous, or abstract requirements from business stakeholders. These vague specifications often lead to misaligned expectations, wasted development time, and costly rework. Without a shared understanding, delivering the right product becomes a game of guesswork, frustrating both teams and delaying progress.\r\n\r\nAcceptance Test-Driven Development (ATDD) solves this problem by introducing clear, executable specifications. ATDD ensures that requirements are expressed as concrete, testable examples, fostering alignment between business and development teams. Instead of interpreting abstract requirements, developers can rely on these tests as a shared \u201csource of truth,\u201d reducing misunderstandings and enhancing confidence in the software being built.\r\n\r\nRobot Framework emerges as a simple yet powerful tool for implementing ATDD. Its keyword-driven, human-readable syntax enables seamless collaboration between technical and non-technical stakeholders, making specifications both executable and accessible. By bridging the communication gap, Robot Framework ensures that everyone \u2014 from business analysts to developers \u2014 shares a common understanding of the system requirements.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we\u2019ll dive into the core concepts of Robot Framework, providing an overview of its structure and capabilities. You\u2019ll see how tests are written in its clear, keyword-driven syntax and explore existing libraries that simplify test automation for common scenarios. Beyond that, we\u2019ll focus on how to extend Robot Framework by building custom Python libraries to address unique project requirements. By combining these elements, you\u2019ll gain a solid understanding of how to leverage Robot Framework effectively, enabling teams to create powerful, maintainable, and collaborative test suites.",

            "description": "With the boom of data, we\u2019re seeing real-time systems cropping up and that means thousands of data streams flowing that power every experience across the internet. But with this, arises the critical need to monitor data quality and metrics, and alerting systems that help escalate unexpected behavior with high confidence. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, we\u2019ll focus on one approach to detect anomalies, which is to forecast for a period in the future and alert if the ground truth is far from this prediction by some amount. Easy-peesy, right? But for this to work, we need\r\n- A performant and efficient forecasting algorithm, that works well for all kinds of data, and, \r\n- An unbiased, and dynamic approach to detect anomalies and not noise \r\n\r\n\r\nFor the first, we\u2019ll leverage NeuralProphet - which is an open-source framework for ML based forecasting that combines the interpretability of linear models with the accuracy of deep neural networks.\r\n \r\nFor the second, we\u2019ll discuss implementing some robust techniques and how they\u2019re useful in the real-time production environment, to prevent anomalous data biasing our system as early as one second later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Outline\r\n\r\n\r\n1. **Introduction to anomaly detection using time series forecasting** (5 min)\r\n- Overview of NeuralProphet (10 min)\r\n- We\u2019ll discuss the key components of NeuralProphet like capturing trend, seasonality and the AR-nets and what gives it an edge over the traditional statistical forecasting algorithms, using code snippets.\r\n- Using neural prophet in real-time - how many periods to forecast ahead? \r\n2. **Using forecast errors to detect anomalies** (12 min): \r\nThe questions I\u2019ll address in this section are:\r\n- Which measures should we use as anomaly scores to prevent bias by anomalous data entering the system in real-time?\r\n- How do we choose lookback windows to compare our current data with?\r\n- How do we tune anomaly score thresholds?\r\n- How do we deal with short-term noise?\r\n- How do we deal with sparse data?\r\n3. **Q&A** (3 min)\r\n\r\n**At the end of the talk, the audience will**\r\n- have knowledge of an end-to-end demo highlighting NeuralProphet\u2019s capabilities\r\n- be equipped with handy tips and techniques to implement automated anomaly detection using open-source tools.",

The definition is unclear, the hype going strong, and the boundaries between agents and other types AI systems - like chatbots - fuzzy. \r\n\r\nThis talk critically examines the concept of AI agents: What makes an agent an agent? Is it tool use, a long planning horizon, a certain degree of autonomy, or something else entirely? We\u2019ll explore the history of AI agents, dissect their characteristics, and contrast marketing language with the reality of the current technological state of the art. Finally, we\u2019ll discuss practical use cases for AI agents and when alternative AI approaches might be more appropriate.",
            "description": "The term \"AI agent\" is thrown around liberally in current AI-related discourse, often with varying definitions and an overwhelming dose of hype. But what does it actually mean? This talk seeks to clarify the concept of agentic AI through four angles:\r\n\r\n1. **What are AI Agents?**: We\u2019ll dive deep into what makes an AI system an \"agent.\" Is it its ability to autonomously plan, adapt, or use external tools? How does it differ from a sophisticated, tool-using chatbot? By analyzing different frameworks and definitions, we\u2019ll aim to distill the the essential properties of agentic systems.\r\n    1. **Technology vs. Interface**: A critical distinction exists between the underlying technology of AI agents and the interfaces through which users interact with them. We\u2019ll explore how user-facing designs shape the perception of an AI system as an agent and whether this distinction helps clarify or muddy the definition.\r\n2. **Why now?, or: beware the snake oil**: The pace of progress in AI is nothing short of dramatic, but that doesn\u2019t mean that every new development will be as groundbreaking as advertised. We take a bird\u2019s eye view of the current development trends in AI and discuss why agents are such a popular concept now. We analyze the marketing lingo by contextualizing who\u2019s pushing for agents right now and they stand to gain from it.\r\n3. **Applications and Use Cases**: Not every problem calls for an AI agent. We\u2019ll evaluate scenarios where agent-based systems excel, such as multi-step task automation, and others where simpler or alternative AI solutions are more effective.\r\n\r\nThroughout the talk, we\u2019ll also take a brief look at the historical evolution of the concept of AI agents, from early academic definitions to today\u2019s commercial implementations.\r\n\r\nBy critically analyzing the concept and separating hype from substance, this talk aims to provide clarity, foster a deeper understanding, and help participants make informed decisions about when\u2014and when not\u2014to deploy AI agents.\r\n\r\n## Takeaways\r\n\r\nAttendees will leave with:\r\n\r\n1. A clearer understanding of what defines an AI agent and how it differs from other AI systems like chatbots, as well as insights into the relationship between an AI agent\u2019s technological backbone and its user-facing interface.\r\n2. Insights into the current state of AI model development, the reasons behind the rising prominence of AI agents, and how much of the hype can be attributed to marketing strategies and venture capital interests rather than genuine technological advancements.\r\n3. Practical guidance on when to use AI agents and when alternative approaches might be more suitable.\r\n\r\nThis talk will enable participants to critically assess the concept of AI agents, navigate the hype, and make better-informed strategic decisions in their AI development and deployment.",

Along the way I have learned a lot about how to teach well, how to build systems that teach well, and how traditional education systems fall short. \r\n\r\nNow, my primary aim is to spread skills to educators. To empower those who empower others.\r\n\r\nI lead the Guild of Educators, a community I founded to empower tech educators through shared resources, support, and evidence-based teaching practices. Additionally, I run Prelude, where I provide rigorous technical training, as well as consultation, and coaching for technical educators, and organisations with education functions (for example grad programs and similar).",

Most organisations typically don't hire junior developers, they focus on mid level talent and upwards. \r\n\r\nThis has consequences for people right now - human potential is being wasted, people are struggling and taking wrong turns.  Training organisations and bootcamps are stepping in to fill gaps with mixed results. There are a lot of sharks in the education space, selling opaque products to people who are looking for answers. \r\n\r\nThis also has long term consequences - where will this industry be in 8 years time given that so few people are getting experience right now?  \r\n\r\nThis is an ecosystem problem. It's very complicated. \r\n\r\nAnd it's further complicated by the rise of LLMs - we're at the brink of something big, but we aren't sure what. Some people think the skill of writing code will not be necessary in 5 years.\r\n\r\nHow do we parse this? If we want to play the long game, as a community, as a society, what should we do?",

            "description": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful tools for tasks like filtering, summarization, and code generation. However, their substantial computational demands result in high costs and limit scalability. To address these challenges, this talk proposes a new approach that moves away from traditional large models. Instead, it introduces a lightweight system made up of open-source Small Language Models (SLMs) managed by a central Master Agent. The Master Agent assigns tasks to specialized Worker Agents, each running an SLM such as Phi3 and 4 or Orca-mini, which are optimized for specific functions. This distribution of tasks among smaller models significantly reduces both resource usage and operational costs. Additionally, scaling the system or adapting to new tasks becomes easier by simply adding or replacing Worker Agents without the complexities of deploying a single large model.\r\n\r\nBeyond cost and scalability, this approach meets the growing need for edge-compatible solutions. Compact SLMs can integrate smoothly into various edge devices, including IoT sensors and mobile applications. This integration allows for low-latency processing, enhances privacy by keeping data local, and even supports offline language processing. As a result, developers can deliver advanced language functionalities directly to users, regardless of infrastructure limitations or connectivity issues. This empowers the creation of applications that are both responsive and secure, catering to diverse environments and user needs.\r\n\r\nOur implementation is primarily in Python and supported by open-source frameworks like Langchain and Hugging Face, encouraging community-driven improvements. The talk will demonstrate how this multi-agent framework optimizes resource use, simplifies maintenance through specialized modules, and ensures reliable performance with robust failover mechanisms. Attendees will learn how to integrate these components into their own projects, taking advantage of a flexible and scalable platform that is both cost-effective and adaptable for future advancements in language processing.",

It's interesting to me, how despite working with Python, for almost 5 years, never really wondered if there could be anything beyond just positional or keyword arguments (Probably the reason we started with C++ as our first programming language, is also to partially blame here). \r\n\r\nWe believe learning about these can help one graduate from just learning a language to actually understanding what writing \"Pythonic\" actually means while designing APIs.

Until a few years ago I would not have shown much interest in this kind of questions, since then I have started going to PyData and PyCon conferences, joined a local Python meetup and started a PyData meetup. And I want to share with you what I learned along the way.",
            "description": "As a Pythonista and Data Scientist, for many years I have never really paid attention to how the tools I use every day are crafted and maintained. I just used them. Then I started going to meetups and conferences and discovered the wonderful group of people that organizes these kind of events. And I decided to try and be part of it. It turns out that Python and PyData communities are extremely welcoming and accessible!\r\n\r\nThis is a talk about the power of community. It also about two specific communities who are behind conferences PyCon and PyData conferences (and sometimes team up to deliver special events). One is about a programming language and targets developers and the wider public of Python users; it is backed by a non profit called the Python Software Foundation. The other, younger, is about Open Source Scientific Software (it is called PyData but its not only about Python) and targets Scientists, Data Scientist and all people who deal with Data and/or Science in some degrees; it is backed by a non profit called NumFocus.\r\n\r\nWhy a talk about both? Because I have been wondering a lot recently about the commonalities and specificities of both of them. There is a personal side of this: one of the reason I joined the Python Milan (>10 year old) community is to get involved in starting a PyData Milan chapter. I think, there is also a general trend of convergence between the two: on one side the Data practice is maturing and learning more from the older (still very young) Software Engineering practice; on the other side, the new (neverending?) summer of AI has pushed a lot of developers to start playing with apis delivering the output of sophisticated models.\r\n\r\nThis talk is divided in three parts each one trying to answer a question:\r\n\r\n1. How do the organizations behind Python and PyData communities work?\r\n2. How do I start (or join) a meetup in one of them and keep it going?\r\n3. Why should I care about both (or not)?\r\n\r\nThe talk aims to be informative, practical, and opinionated and targets beginners and experts alike. It will not be an easy task to be focused and concise about a topic I am passionate about but I will try very hard and I hope you will enjoy it!",

            "description": "In general elections, voters often face the  challenge of navigating complex political landscapes. These challenges include understanding the differences between nuanced policy positions, comparing extensive party manifestos, and reconciling conflicting information from various sources. The sheer volume of information and the high frequency of elections can lead to voter fatigue and disengagement [1]. Existing tools like Wahlomat are helpful for voters but don\u2019t adapt well to individual preferences or specific questions. To address these issues, we developed Electify\u2014an interactive application designed to empower voters by addressing these pain points. \r\n\r\nUsing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Electify simplifies the decision-making process by enabling users to access concise and relevant summaries of political party positions tailored to their individual queries. Our user interface provides the possibility to fact-check the generated responses by directly showing the original sources. Additionally, we included a blinding feature to combat confirmation bias: users can hide party names and read summaries of their positions before unblinding. This talk will explore the technical development and deployment of Electify, covering its  architecture, integration of data from party manifestos and parliamentary speeches, and strategies to maintain political neutrality and accuracy in responses. In particular, we will discuss our efforts to use reranking to improve context relevancy and LLM-as-a-judge evaluation for parameter optimization. We identify a trade-off between factual accuracy and the frequency of denied responses, which we think is highly relevant for generative AI systems that operate within sensitive areas like voter information [2].\r\n\r\nDuring its first roll-out for the European Election 2024, Electify received significant attention, attracting 6,000 active users who leveraged the platform to make more informed and confident voting decisions. We will address the lessons learned from user feedback and discuss the ethical considerations involved, emphasizing the potential of generative AI to enhance voter information systems and promote political engagement.\r\n\r\nContributors: Christian Liedl, Anna Neifer, Joshua Nowak\r\n[Github Repository](https://github.com/electify-eu/europarl-ai)\r\n\r\n[1] Kostelka et al. \"Election frequency and voter turnout.\" Comparative Political Studies 56.14 (2023)\r\n[2] Cao, Lang. \"Learn to Refuse: Making Large Language Models More Controllable and Reliable through Knowledge Scope Limitation and Refusal Mechanism.\" arXiv:2311.01041 (2023).",

Well, in this talk, lets design fair, unbiased and fault-tolerant ML architectures with ease.",
            "description": "Scaling machine learning across distributed systems introduces significant challenges, particularly when deploying models that impact people's lives. The risk of deploying biased and unfair models is amplified in distributed environments, potentially leading to discriminatory outcomes, especially for marginalized groups. This talk introduces distributed machine learning architectures, focusing on building fair, unbiased, and efficient systems in Python, further diving into various architectures like data parallelism, model parallelism, and hybrid approaches. Crucially, we will see how to address the ethical imperative of fairness, delving into the root causes of bias in machine learning and techniques to mitigate it within distributed settings. Through practical examples and a live demo, we will see how to implement scalable ML architectures that incorporate data sharding, model synchronization, and fault tolerance while prioritizing fairness and transparency.",

This approach works well for single-node tasks, but scaling to handle larger datasets or more resource-intensive computations introduces significant challenges. Not to mention, using GPUs requires another level of complexity. We present the cuPyNumeric library.  cuPyNumeric gives developers the same familiar NumPy interface, but seamlessly distributes work across CPUs and GPUs.\r\n\r\nA compelling example when scaling is necessary is when scientists at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center(SLAC) need to process a large amount of data within a fixed time window, called beam time.  The full dataset generated during experiments is too large to be processed on a single CPU. Additionally, the code often must be modified during the beam time to adapt to changing experimental needs. Being able to use NumPy syntax rather than lower level distributed computing libraries makes these changes quick and easy, allowing researchers to focus on conducting more experiments rather than debugging or optimizing code.\r\n\r\ncuPyNumeric is designed to be a drop-in replacement to NumPy. Built on top of task-based distributed runtime from Stanford University, it automatically parallelizes NumPy APIs across all available resources, taking care of data distribution, communication, asynchronous and accelerated execution of compute kernels on both GPUs or multi-core CPUs.  In addition, cuPyNumeric can be integrated with other popular Python libraries like SciPy, matplotlib, Jax.  With cuPyNumeric, SLAC scientists successfully ran their data processing code distributed across multiple nodes and GPUs, processing the full dataset with a 6x speed-up compared to the original single-node implementation.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we showcase the productivity and performance of cuPyNumeric library covering some detail on its implementation.",

Using Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX), I will show how to optimize machine learning models for significant applications such as detecting abnormalities all without reliance on cloud dependent systems.",
            "description": "Edge AI refers to the practice of running artificial intelligence algorithms and models directly on edge devices, like smartphones, smart watches, IoT devices, cameras, or other embedded systems, instead of relying on centralized cloud servers.\r\nAsides from the fact that this reduces reliance on cloud servers which can be expensive, it also enables real time monitoring and improves accessibility to AI powered diagnostics.\r\n\r\nFor instance, Imagine wearing a smartwatch that monitors your heart rate, blood pressure and oxygen level and then processes this data locally to detect anomalies in your health.\r\nIn addition to being quick and portable, it solves the problem of unmet diagnostic needs.\r\n\r\nThis talk, focuses on how to deploy AI models on Edge devices to address diagnostics challenges and increase efficiency in healthcare settings.\r\nUsing Open Neural Network Exchange(ONNX), a framework valued because of its cross platform compatibility and ability to seamlessly convert  frameworks, I will demonstrate how to optimize models for tasks like detecting medical imaging abnormalities, monitoring vital signs, and identifying early warning signs of chronic conditions. Attendees will learn techniques to provide efficient AI solutions on devices like smartphones and IoT sensors, which will help to reduce the need for constant cloud connectivity and enhance  healthcare accessibility in remote ans underserved areas.",

With Python, Kafka and Iceberg, of course!\r\n\r\nWe built a large-scale data lakehouse based on Apache Iceberg for the Schwarz Group, Europe's largest retailer. The system collects business data from thousands of stores, warehouses and offices across Europe.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will present our architecture, the challenges we faced, and how Apache Iceberg is shaping up to be the data lakehouse format of the future.",
            "description": "The Schwarz Group is present in thirty-two countries around the world with over ten thousand stores, hundreds of warehouses, an assortment of over two thousand different products and a single ERP system to manage them all.\r\n\r\nEvery country maintains its own databases for operational purposes but all the data is also gathered in one central analytics platform for all countries. Not only does this platform need to be stable and reliable, the data also needs to be made available for the consumers in near real-time \u2013within mere minutes. The existing analytics platform was based on proprietary solutions which were expensive and required niche knowledge, severely limiting the number of available developers.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we set out on a journey to completely redesign the analytics platform; a new solution, based as much as possible on Open Source technologies like Python, Kafka and Iceberg. Leveraging Python for its great ecosystem and ease of use. Kafka for fast and reliable message processing of over one thousand tables per country into one central hub. And Iceberg at the core, as our data lakehouse format for its fully transparent schema evolution and high performance through its rich metadata layer.\r\nThrough our presentation we will showcase the different challenges we faced during the desing of our new architecture, how our selected tech stack allowed us to tackle each of them and the lessons we learnt. We will focus on our challenges in four areas: scalability, performance, continuity of service and data quality.\r\n\r\nScalability: Ingesting changes on over one thousand tables coming from servers across thirty-two countries supporting operations of Europe\u2019s largest retailer is no easy task. Our architecture needs to support receiving tens of thousands of events per second. We will present how we set up Kafka to support our current load and potential for future growth, how we use Tabular\u2019s Iceberg sink connector to ingest all our tables, and how we leverage avro serialization and snappy compression of messages to reduce network traffic.\r\n\r\nPerformance: The large amounts of data we handle, paired with the influx of small files that can result from real-time data ingestion, made ensuring performance an extremely challenging aspect of our application. We will show how we designed our data lake house; using Icebergs hidden partitioning to ensure performance while remaining flexible to evolve them over time and how we designed and implemented an effective maintenance job to reduce small files in our iceberg tables.\r\n\r\nContinuity of Service: The existing analytics platform contains the core of the business data which is used for many analytics and forecasting use cases across the organization. One of main requirements was to ensure a smooth transition to the new architecture with as little downtime as possible. This meant facilitating the access to existing users by allowing them to retrieve the data in the same way they were doing it in the past, with minimal changes. We will show how our architecture ensures flexibility by allowing access to the data from many engines and show an example on how we integrated our architecture with Snowflake. \r\n\r\nData quality: We faced some challenges when it came to the consolidation of all the data we receive from all countries. For some tables, the schemas diverged across countries having different sets of columns, different data types being used and even different primary keys. We will talk about how we handled data quality issues coming from the operational databases by using iceberg\u2019s schema evolution capabilities, a schema registry and Kafka Connect single message transforms (SMTs).",

You're not alone - stock outs can have significant consequences for businesses, resulting in frustrated customers and lost sales. On the other hand, overstocking can lead to wasted storage costs and potential write-offs. The replenishment system is responsible for striking the right balance between these opposing risks.\r\nThe key to successful replenishment is making accurate predictions about future demand. \r\n\r\nThis presentation takes a deep dive into the intricate world of demand forecasting, at Europe's largest retailer. We will demonstrate how enhancing simple machine learning methods with domain knowledge allows to generate hundreds of millions of high-quality forecasts every day.",
            "description": "This talk will provide an in-depth look at the forecasting engine, the heart of Lidl's replenishment system.\r\n\r\nEach day at Lidl, hundreds of millions of various products journey from suppliers to warehouses before reaching the shelves. Our so-called forecasting engine helps to automate the supply chain at every step along the way. \r\nEven with the vast amount of data at our disposal, the problem is still extraordinarily intricate. Each item, store or warehouse has unique demand patterns influenced heavily by a wide range of factors, such as holidays. While most of the effects are quantifiable, others remain unavailable and a certain degree of stochasticity is inherent to the process. The objective of our demand prediction may also vary based on their usages. Accuracy on the day level typically matters for short-term predictions, while it doesn't for long-term predictions. \r\n\r\nWe'll present our pragmatic modeling methodology on a simplified version of the problem at hand: The warehouse forecasting of single items. \r\n\r\nWe explain the rationale for training separate models for each item-warehouse combination and go into the reasons why we opted for using a LGBM model and why we believe it is best suited for our application. In addition to outlining our high-level modeling approach, we demonstrate how business and domain expertise are integrated into the modeling process through the use of sample and feature weighting and examine the impact of this integration on prediction quality. Following the base model, extensions are introduced that enable the incorporation of higher-level information at the finest level of granularity. This is achieved through decomposition and recomposition of the time-series at hand. In detail, we will present uplift decomposition for different use-cases, which include handling of promotions and holidays.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, we will give an overview of how all the presented methods synergize in delivering reliable forecasts for happy customers, so that you will hopefully never find yourself in front of an empty shelf!",

            "description": "Let me share a story with you about two developers working at a Malt, Europe's leading freelance management system & marketplace. \r\n\r\nDev-1: Hi there! We have an issue on production. It seems that a request was sent where \u201ccompany id\u201d is not given. \r\nDev-2: Oops! But I thought we agreed on an anonymous mode?\r\nDev-1: That\u2019s actually a great idea. You mean that company id is not required? \r\nDev-2: Exactly!\r\nDev-1: Thanks! I will update the data model and push the changes! \r\n\r\nAs the conversation above suggests, sending data between two applications can easily fail if the requirements are not defined up front. Even for simple requests a lot of decisions have to be made: are the fields optional or mandatory? What about the returned payloads and their data types? Do we need default values? If we are not clear what we will expect (from the request) and what we will return (in the response), in the worst case, the request will fail and we spend time debugging, like above.  \r\n\r\nTo overcome this issue, we decided to move to a contract-first approach, where we define the exact request and response and generate the endpoints and data models from there using the OpenAPI generator. The OpenAPI generator is a powerful tool that allows you to automatically generate API client libraries, server stubs, documentation, and configuration from an OpenAPI specification, or a \u201ccontract\u201d between two applications. This contract forms the basis for generating the endpoint stubs for our python applications but also for the client models and code. Starting with the contract can significantly speed up the development process and improve the consistency of your API implementations.\r\n\r\nDuring this talk we will address the following topics: \r\n- The vanilla implementation that generates endpoints and data models: what would you need to run to have a first version of the FastAPI endpoints. If the setting allows for it, we would show a short demonstration. \r\n- How to use customisable templates: we customised the mustache templates that generated the endpoints and data models so we could generate our custom FastAPI app. Also we added examples to the generated data models as these were not available in the default implementation. \r\n- How to customise the CLI tool and ideas for setting up your CI pipeline: we will share some ideas how to customise the CLI and how we used it in our CI pipeline to prevent discrepancies between the contract and the generated stubs.\r\n- how to maintain the contract and how to handle breaking changes to the contract\r\nWe will close the session with a discussion of the challenges and benefits of implementing the OpenAPI Generator. While it offers standardisation and best practices, it can introduce additional complexity, especially with the tool still in beta. We'll share our experiences navigating this trade-off.",

This new breed of models broadened the concept of scaling laws, shifting focus from **train-time** to **test-time** (or inference-time) compute. How do these models work?

Our RAG chatbot for R&D experts accesses over 50,000 documents across numerous SharePoint sites and other sources. We identified three key success factors:\r\n1. Developing a robust data pipeline that syncs documents from source systems and that handles enterprise features such as replicating user permissions. \r\n2. Establishing a comprehensive evaluation framework with a clear optimization metric.\r\n3. Driving adoption through an onboarding training and ongoing user engagement, such as regular office hours.\r\n\r\nWe think that many of these lessons are broadly applicable to RAG chatbots, making this talk valuable for practitioners aiming to implement GenAI solutions in business contexts.",
            "description": "Building a prototype RAG chatbot with frameworks like LangChain can be straightforward. However, scaling it into a production-grade application introduces complex challenges. In this talk, we share our lessons learned from developing a RAG chatbot designed to assist research and development (R&D) experts.\r\n\r\nOur chatbot was developed to effectively handle and provide access to a large collection of unstructured knowledge, consisting of over 50,000 documents stored across more than 20 SharePoint sites and other sources. We faced significant hurdles in:\r\n- **Data Pipeline Engineering**: Crafting a modular and scalable pipeline capable of periodically syncing documents, handling dynamic user permissions, and efficiently processing large volumes of unstructured data.\r\n- **Evaluation Framework Development**: Implementing an effective testing strategy without the availability of static ground truth data. We employed automated testing with frameworks like pytest, utilized LLM-as-a-judge, and integrated tracing to iteratively refine our dataset and maintain high answer quality.\r\n- **RAG Design and Prompting Strategies**: Addressing challenges in document chunking, citation integration, reranking retrieved results, and applying permission and PII filters to ensure compliance and accuracy in responses.\r\n- **User Adoption**: Driving user adoption through onboarding training and ongoing engagement, such as regular office hours and feedback mechanisms.\r\n\r\nWe emphasize the importance of applying data science principles to GenAI projects:\r\n- **Start Simple and Iterate**: Begin with a basic implementation as a baseline and iteratively enhance functionality based on testing and user feedback.\r\n- **Test-Driven Development**: Identify key test scenarios early and use them to drive development, ensuring that improvements are measurable and aligned with growing user needs.\r\n- **Focus on Key Metrics**: Establish clear metrics to optimize against, aiding in making informed decisions throughout the development process.\r\n  \r\n**Main Takeaways for the Audience:**\r\n- Understand the critical role of robust, modular data pipelines in handling dynamic and unstructured data sources for LLM applications.\r\n- Learn strategies for developing effective evaluation frameworks in complex domains where traditional ground truth data may be lacking.\r\n- Gain insights into advanced RAG design techniques that enhance chatbot performance and reliability.\r\n- Recognize the substantial data engineering and software development efforts required to transition a prototype to a production-grade LLM solution.\r\n\r\nBy sharing our experiences, attendees will gain practical insights into deploying robust RAG chatbots, transforming a functional prototype into a reliable, scalable application that fulfills enterprise requirements.",

            "description": "Demand forecasting is a crucial element in the retail and manufacturing sectors, ensuring products are produced and delivered efficiently while minimizing waste. To enhance decision-making and refine model development workflows, it's vital to understand and explain model predictions by evaluating the influence of input data and identifying deviations from actual outcomes.\r\nShapley values provide a powerful framework for model explainability by offering additive marginal contributions of model features to predictions. Their nature, where the sum of all Shapley values equals the model prediction, makes them easily interpretable and widely adopted. However, calculating Shapley values can be computationally demanding, especially when scaling up to handle large datasets.\r\nIn our approach, we employ, alongside other models, generalized additive model (GAM)-inspired architectures with exponential link functions for demand predictions, which inherently provide multiplicative factor explanations. I will demonstrate how we efficiently compute Shapley values from these factor explanations, allowing us to generate them alongside predictions with minimal overhead, directly into a Snowflake database.\r\nThis talk will delve into the challenges and solutions for scaling model explanations, highlighting the fundamental differences between additive and multiplicative model explanations and their impact on interpretation. Additionally, I will discuss how Snowflake empowers us to aggregate Shapley values across extensive customer datasets, enabling the visualization of model explainability at various scales. This capability is crucial for providing actionable insights and ensuring that model transparency is maintained even as data volumes grow.",

However, because CGM data are not originally intended for research purposes, exports from CGM devices and online portals often fail to meet scientific standards. Even though the exports are available in CSV or XLSX format, they are rarely machine-readable, have inconsistent structures and lack metadata or documentation. These challenges make importing, harmonizing and preparing data for research time-consuming, error-prone and vulnerable to data loss.\r\n\r\nTo address these challenges, we developed GluCINDa (Glucose: Coherent Import. Neat Data.), a Python-based tool designed to automate CGM data processing. GluCINDa supports various file and table formats, detects glucose measurements with associated date and time information, and produces harmonized datasets suitable for research. She also generates comprehensive documentation files, ensuring every parsed value is traceable, alongside summary reports that provide an overview of the extracted data. To make the software accessible to a wide range of users, GluCINDa features a graphical user interface (GUI) with a simple mode for basic tasks and an advanced mode offering customizable settings.\r\n\r\nGluCINDa significantly outperforms traditional data import methods, delivering faster processing while minimizing (human) error and preventing data loss from messy input files. By adhering to scientific standards of traceability, transparency, and rigorous documentation, GluCINDa enhances the quality and reliability of CGM data for diabetes research.",

            "abstract": "The Transformer architecture, originally designed for machine translation, has revolutionized deep learning with applications in natural language processing, computer vision, and time series forecasting. Recently, its capabilities have extended to sequence-to-sequence tasks involving log data, such as telemetric event data from computer games.\r\n\r\nThis talk demonstrates how to apply a Transformer-based model to game log data, showcasing its potential for sequence prediction and representation learning. Attendees will gain insights into implementing a simple Transformer in Python, optimizing it through hyperparameter tuning, architectural adjustments, and defining an appropriate vocabulary for game logs.\r\n\r\nReal-world applications, including clustering and user level predictions, will be explored using a dataset of over 175 million events from an MMORPG. The talk will conclude with a discussion of the model's performance, computational requirements, and future opportunities for this approach.",
            "description": "The paper[1] introducing the Transformer architecture has been cited almost 150k times. By now, this deep learning architecture has been used for a large number of use cases. Obviously, language generation and large language models are among the most prominent use cases. However, the architecture has also been successfully employed to solve problems in computer vision and to forecast time series data to name only a few other examples.\r\n\r\nAt its core, the Transformer architecture is a deep neural network designed for sequence-to-sequence prediction tasks. E.g., mapping a sequence of words in one language to a sequence of words in another language as it is done in machine translation tasks. This architecture has recently gained attention for another application well-suited to sequence-to-sequence mapping: the analysis of telemetric log data from games[2]. While log data from games is one specific area that has been explored lately, this approach generally works for log data in other domains arising from websites or mobile apps.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will walk the audience through a simple Transformer architecture in Python that can be used to train a model on game log data. I will discuss the challenges of constructing a vocabulary and tokenizer based on log data. Unlike language data, game logs often contain structured events with properties, making vocabulary design non-trivial. I will highlight design choices in the model construction to balance the predictive power of the model and computational efficiency. This includes hyper-parameter selection for the model (e.g., embedding size, number of layers, etc.) and the training procedure (e.g., batch size, learning rate, etc.). I will also explain how to adapt the Transformer architecture to handle long sequences of log data efficiently, including architectural changes to the basic network.\r\n\r\nI will demonstrate how representations derived from the model can be applied to various use cases, such as clustering and prediction tasks arising in game data science. Typical prediction tasks in game data science are survival time prediction for regression or purchase prediction for classification. Insights from clustering or player level predictions can help to improve retention or optimize monetization models. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, I trained multiple models on a publicly available 100GB game log dataset containing over 175 million events from NCSOFT\u2019s MMORPG Blade and Soul. In addition to presenting qualitative results, I will compare the computational resources and hardware requirements of this method to those of a simple baseline algorithm. \r\n\r\nBy the end of the talk, attendees will gain actionable insights into building and training Transformers for log data, equipping them to tackle similar challenges in their own domains.\r\n\r\nTentative agenda of the talk:\r\n5  - Intro\r\n5  - Review of the Transformer architecture and its usage in GPT\r\n10 - Adjusting the architecture to game log data\r\n10 - Training of different models\r\n10 - Obtaining player representations from the models for clustering and prediction tasks\r\n5  - Outlook & Conclusion\r\n\r\n[1] \u201cAttention is all you need\u201d, Vaswani et al., 2017\r\n[2] \u201cplayer2vec: A Language Modeling Approach to Understand Player Behavior in Games\u201d, Wang et al., 2024\r\n[3] \u201cGame Data Mining Competition on Churn Prediction and Survival Analysis using Commercial Game Log Data\u201d, Lee et al., 2018",

We\u2019ll explore its theoretical underpinnings, practical implementations using TorchCP, and transformative impact on safety-critical fields like healthcare, robotics, and NLP. Whether you're building predictive systems or deploying AI in high-stakes environments, this session will provide actionable insights to level up your modelling skills for robust decision-making.",
            "description": "When deploying machine learning models in the real world, especially in domains like healthcare, robotics, or natural language processing, the stakes are high. It\u2019s not enough to train a model, evaluate its accuracy, and call it a day. Questions of how confident the model is, how reliable its predictions are, and how to act on these predictions are critical yet often overlooked. This talk takes you beyond conventional metrics and into the world of uncertainty quantification and probability calibration, with conformal prediction as the definitive tool for both.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ll start of the presentation by exploring the fundamental need for uncertainty in AI systems\u2014why it matters, how it\u2019s quantified, and how it can be used to make informed decisions. From there, we\u2019ll introduce conformal prediction, a mathematically rigorous yet practical framework that provides guarantees on prediction reliability while remaining model-agnostic. Core concepts such as probability calibration and uncertainty quantification will be highlighted as key parts in the modelling process, establishing their importance in the domain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe session will also feature real-world examples and use cases such as:\r\n\r\n- Healthcare: Predict disease likelihood with quantifiable confidence, such as identifying risks in MRI scans.\r\n\r\n- Robotics: Navigate dynamic environments safely using calibrated vision-based models.\r\n\r\n- Natural Language Processing: Improve outputs of large language models with uncertainty-aware predictions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, we\u2019ll showcase the TorchCP toolbox, a GPU-accelerated library for integrating conformal prediction into deep learning pipelines, an area of Data Science that has a lot of hype but often overlooks the importance of such tools. Through a live demonstration, you\u2019ll see how to implement these methods step-by-step, empowering you to build trustworthy AI systems that go beyond accuracy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAttendees will leave with:\r\n\r\n- A solid understanding of uncertainty quantification, probability calibration and their importance.\r\n\r\n- Practical knowledge of conformal prediction and how to implement it.\r\n\r\n- A new perspective on AI reliability and decision-making in critical domains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhether you're an ML researcher, data scientist, or practitioner deploying AI models in critical environments, this session will equip you with the right tools and philosophy to create AI systems that are not only accurate but also reliable and robust.",

If you write a tool which only supports pandas, users will demand support for Polars, PyArrow, DuckDB, and so many other libraries that you'll feel like giving up.\r\n\r\nLearn about how Narwhals allows you to write dataframe-agnostic tools which can support all of the above, with zero dependencies, low overhead, static typing, and strong backwards-compatibility promises!",
            "description": "Suppose you want to write a data science tool to do feature engineering. Your experience may go like this:\r\n- Expectation: you can focus on state-of-the art techniques for feature engineering.\r\n- Reality: you keep having to make you codebase more complex because a new dataframe library has come out and users are demanding support for it.\r\n\r\nOr rather, it might have gone like that in the pre-Narwhals era. Because now, you can focus on solving the problems which your tool set out to do, and let Narwhals handle the subtle differences between different kinds of dataframe inputs!\r\n\r\nNarwhals is a lightweight and extensible compatibility layer between dataframe libraries. It is already used by several open source libraries including Altair, Marimo, Plotly, Scikit-lego, Vegafusion, and more. You will learn how to use Narwhals to build dataframe-agnostic tools.\r\n\r\nThis is a technical talk aimed at tool-builders. You'll be expected to be familiar with Python and dataframes. We will cover:\r\n- 2-3 minutes: motivation. Why are there so many dataframe libraries?\r\n- 2-3: minutes: life before vs after Narwhals - real-world examples of how the data landscape is changing\r\n- 7-8 minutes: basics of Narwhals, wrapping native objects, expressions vs Series, lazy vs eager\r\n- 7-8 minutes: advanced Narwhals concepts: row order, non-elementary group-by aggregations, multi-indices, null values, backwards-compatibility promises\r\n- 2-3 minutes: what comes next?\r\n- 5 minutes: engaging Q&A / awkward silence\r\n\r\nTool builders will benefit from the talk by learning how to build tools for modern dataframe libraries without sacrificing support for foundational classic libraries such as pandas.",

            "description": "In this talk, we\u2019ll begin by introducing the concept of real-world evidence datasets and their transformative impact on cancer research. We\u2019ll explore the significant challenges of building high-quality real-world evidence datasets, including the fragmented healthcare data landscape, the complexity of source data, and stringent regulatory constraints.\r\n\r\nTo address these challenges, we\u2019ll introduce our privacy-enhancing data architecture and foundational technology stack, which includes AWS, Snowflake, Python, DLT, DBT, Pandas, and DuckDB. We\u2019ll explain how we leverage these tools to establish critical feedback loops and accelerate actionable insights. Key topics include:\r\n\r\n- Integrating notebooks with production pipelines to bridge the gap between clinical domain expertise and production workflows.\r\n- Employing a write-audit-publish pattern to ensure continuous data quality through unit tests, data tests, regression tests, and cohort-spanning statistical tests.\r\n- Using DLT to move normalization steps closer to the data source, unlocking iterative data modeling and enabling more agile development cycles.\r\n\r\nOne of our most impactful innovations was shifting data investigations to the left. Previously, raw data inspections were delayed until pre-processed data was available in our data warehouse, causing prolonged feedback loops and inefficiencies. Disorganized file formats often required data scientists to manually inspect data, limiting their ability to draw meaningful, cohort-wide conclusions.\r\n\r\nTo overcome these challenges, we established local databases directly on compute instances where raw data is stored, leveraging the flexibility and transparency of this approach. Transformations developed within this setup can seamlessly transfer to the cloud data warehouse while remaining portable and adaptable to various environments. This enabled our data scientists to explore and understand the data earlier in the process, eliminating bottlenecks. With immediate access to organized datasets, our team could quickly assess incoming data, provide actionable feedback, and begin building analytical models.\r\n\r\nThis proactive, iterative approach not only streamlined workflows but also fostered deeper collaboration between data engineers and data scientists, ultimately accelerating the generation of high-quality insights for cancer research.",

            "description": "- Why Bayesian Neural Networks?\r\nBayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) has a unique advantage over traditional neural networks: they provide uncertainty estimates in their predictions. While other techniques can approximate uncertainty, the Bayesian framework naturally incorporates it, providing confidence interval in model outputs. This is important for applications where understanding model uncertainty is just as important as making accurate predictions.\r\n\r\n- Conceptual Overview\r\nIn the Bayesian paradigm, the neural network's parameters (weights and biases) are treated as random variables, rather than fixed values. To generate predictive distributions, BNNs assume these parameters follow some probability distributions. Instead of sampling from the posterior distribution (which is computationally expensive), variational inference is used for scalability. Here, an approximate distribution (usually simpler) is optimized by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the true posterior and the approximation. At inference time, the BNN behaves as an ensemble of models, with weights and biases sampled from the learned distributions. This enables the generation of multiple outputs for the same input, from which confidence intervals can be computed.\r\n\r\n- How It Works - An Example\r\nWe will walk through a short demo where a BNN is applied to a dataset.",

As an illustration the talk will feature strange and other-wordly sounds.",
            "description": "The Western music tradition is ubiquitous. Nearly all musical production of the last and current century is build on the assumption that melodies and chords are chosen from a selection of 12 notes per octave. This is reflected in music theory libraries (like music21 and mingus), most of which have built this assumption deep into their design. However the Western system is only one among many: Modern Arabic Music selects from a set of 24 notes, Turkish music even from 53. Other experimental systems have been proposed and aroused recent interest from composers of various genres.\r\n\r\nTo address this problem, xenharmlib was created, a python library for computational music theory that allows the programmer-composer to freely choose the system of tonality underlying chords, scales and melodies. The talk will make you familiar with the basic concepts of alternative tonality and how to model useful structures with xenharmlib. Examples of experimental tonality will be played accompanying the code snippets.",

As a sector we can be hyper-focused on technical process and function, to the extent that it blinkers our understanding of the cultural and political impacts of our work. Aesthetics infuse every aspect of technology. Aesthetic interpretations are manifold and mutable, constructed in-congress with the observer and not fully defined by the original designer. AI technologies add additional layers of subtext: character, consciousness, agency, intent.\r\n\r\nDespite this murkiness, or perhaps because of it, this talk makes an passionate argument for engaging with historical aesthetic movements, for building our shared professional knowledge of fads and fashions\u23afnot just from the past 40 years of internet culture\u23afbut also the past 140 years of ideology, technology, and thought.",

Beneath this technical layer lies a rich but often unexamined tapestry of visual and cultural decisions that profoundly shape how we perceive, interact with, and ultimately integrate AI systems into our society. \r\n\r\nThis talk moves beyond simple visual design to explore how aesthetics \u2013 study of the principles of beauty and artistic taste \u2013 shapes both the creation and interpretation of AI technologies. The aesthetic choices woven into today\u2019s AI interfaces, both for end-users and industry practitioners, reveal our deep-seated assumptions about the world. \r\n\r\nPhilosophers of art ask us to introspect: What is goodness? What is beauty? Which endeavours are most worthy of our attention? We can use these same questions to explore the ideas framing AI.\r\n\r\n\u201cAll watched over by machines of loving grace\u201d, a poem by Richard Brautigan, imagines a utopian future where the natural and technological worlds achieve balance and harmony, and where humans are free to pursue creative, embodied pursuits, freed of menial labour. Is this the utopia imagined by OpenAI or DeepMind when they describe the imminent arrival of AGI? Does the world as described by the big brands of AI actually align with our own imaginings of progress, of utopia? \r\n\r\nA brief historical overview will trace how technological aesthetics have evolved, examining how different eras have visualized and presented technological innovations. This context sets the stage for drawing direct connections between current AI aesthetics and historical movements \u2013 revealing how contemporary design choices often unconsciously echo past ideological and artistic approaches.\r\n\r\nThrough these connections, I\u2019ll demonstrate why developing a broader aesthetic literacy is crucial for AI practitioners. Understanding these historical and cultural reference points can lead to more thoughtful and effective uses of AI. As our field continues to shape the future of human-machine interaction, this aesthetic awareness becomes not just an academic exercise, but a practical necessity: providing both the groundwork for nuanced critique, and the capacity to clearly define how we expect technologies to fit into and improve our lives.",

            "description": "Flame cutting is a method where metals are efficiently cut using precise control of the oxygen jet and consistent mixing of fuel gas. The condition of the nozzle is changing over time: deposits formed during the cutting process degrade the flame quality, reducing the precision of the cut. Currently, nozzle testing relies on manual inspections, where experts visually and audibly evaluate the flame. This method is risky, as worn nozzles may remain in operation, posing safety hazards through ejection of high-temperature material. Additionally, the process is costly, especially when industrial equipment is damaged.\r\n\r\nLaboratory Evaluation: This section outlines the preliminary experiments aimed at assessing whether this sensor is suitable for distinguishing different machine states. The experiments focus on identifying the optimal sensor placement and analyzing how various machine states impact sensor readings. The design process for the laboratory experiments and the subsequent systematic data collection is shown. The results suggest that while detecting every machine state may not be feasible, the sensor shows promise in identifying degraded nozzles.\r\n\r\nData Preprocessing & Annotation: For a proof of concept, the raw acoustic emission data required manual labeling, as prior assessments depended on expert evaluations. Here, we utilized Label Studio, an annotation tool that streamlines the labeling process. \r\nModelling  & Feature Engineering: We extract features using statistical methods and transform the acoustic emission signals into the frequency domain through scipy, focusing on features in  the frequency domain.\r\n\r\nEvaluation: We discuss the approach for splitting the data, considering that multiple observations from the same nozzle are present. In a computational study, we evaluate the feature sets developed in the previous step using two different classification models: Support Vector Classifier and Multilayer Perceptron. This section explains how the experiments are computed and parallelized including the time required for execution.\r\n\r\nLastly, we discuss the dataset's limitations and the challenges faced during development. We also highlight steps taken to improve generalization and provide an outlook on future objectives, mostly aimed at a broader applicability of the models.",

            "description": "Among popular open-source MLOps tools, **Kubeflow** stands out as a Kubernetes-native platform designed to support the entire ML lifecycle, from data preprocessing to model training, deployment, and retraining. Its modular structure enables the integration of a wide range of tools, making it a highly versatile framework for building scalable and reproducible ML workflows. Despite this, most existing resources focus on individual components rather than demonstrating how these can be orchestrated into a seamless, end-to-end pipeline.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we present a practical case study that highlights the potential of Kubeflow in a real-world application. Specifically, we showcase how an automated ML pipeline for anomaly detection in International Space Station (ISS) telemetry data can be built and deployed using Kubeflow and other open-source MLOps tools. The dataset, originating from the Columbus module of the ISS, introduces unique challenges due to its complexity and high-dimensional nature, providing an excellent testbed for MLOps workflows.\r\n\r\n### **What makes this approach unique?**\r\n\r\nOur workflow is built entirely in Python, leveraging Kubeflow\u2019s Python SDK to orchestrate every stage of the pipeline. This eliminates the need for manual interaction with Kubernetes or container configurations, making the process accessible to ML engineers and data scientists without extensive DevOps expertise.\r\n\r\n### **Key takeaways for attendees:**\r\n\r\n*   **Tool integration:** Learn how to combine Dask for distributed preprocessing, Katib for hyperparameter optimization, PyTorch Operator for distributed training, MLFlow for experiment tracking and monitoring, and KServe for scalable model serving. These tools are orchestrated into a unified pipeline using Kubeflow Pipelines.\r\n*   **Overcoming challenges:** Gain insights into the technical hurdles faced during the implementation of this pipeline and discover the strategies and best practices that made it possible.\r\n*   **Real-world impact:** Understand how to apply MLOps principles to complex, real-world datasets and how these principles translate into scalable, maintainable, and reproducible workflows.\r\n\r\nTo ensure reproducibility and accessibility, the entire pipeline, including configurations and code, is publicly available in our GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/hsteude/code-ml4cps-paper). Attendees will be able to replicate the workflow, adapt it to their own use cases, or extend it with additional features.\r\n\r\n### **Who should attend?**\r\n\r\nThis session is designed for data scientists, ML engineers, and Python enthusiasts who want to simplify the development of scalable ML pipelines. Whether you're new to Kubernetes or looking to streamline your MLOps workflows, this talk will provide actionable insights and tools to help you succeed.",

However, despite the wide range of information available, there is often a problem that citizens have difficulty finding the desired information. To address this widespread issue, an AI-based search was developed that can process natural language questions, thus improving the accessibility of information.\r\n\r\nThis presentation addresses the relevant problem of information retrieval, which many cities and institutions face, and shows how Munich has solved it using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). RAG is a technique that enhances the capabilities of language models (LLMs) by integrating information from external data sources to generate more precise and relevant answers.\r\n\r\nThe implementation of the AI-based search was carried out using various open-source components:\r\n- Qdrant: A vector database that holds the content as vectors.\r\n- Langchain: An abstraction layer for LLMs.\r\n- Langfuse: Used for monitoring and evaluating LLM based applications.\r\n- Litellm: A proxy layer for LLMs and embedding models, which simplifies access to and integration of various models.\r\n\r\nSpecial emphasis is placed on the continuous improvement of the search function through the use of test datasets. These data sets are used to evaluate the performance of the search function and to make targeted improvements.  Additionally, monitoring is supplemented by user feedback to ensure that the search function meets user requirements.\r\n\r\nThe main points of the presentation include:\r\n- The detailed structure and individual components of the RAG system.\r\n- The steps for continuous improvement and evaluation of the search function.\r\n- Monitoring methods during live operation, including user feedback.\r\n- The integration and use of the open-source components Langchain, Langfuse, and Litellm.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the presentation, attendees will have understood how to implement, continuously improve and monitor an AI-based search in live operation.

Or wanted to fundamentally improve a Python library by rewriting everything in a faster language like C or Rust? Well, wish no more... NetworkX's backend dispatching mechanism redirects your plain old NetworkX function calls to a FASTER implementation present in a separate backend package by leveraging the Python's [`entry_point`](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/entry-points) specification!\r\n\r\n[NetworkX](https://github.com/networkx/networkx) is a popular, pure Python library used for graph(aka network) analysis. But as the graph size increases (like a network of everyone in the world), the NetworkX algorithms could take days to solve a simple graph analysis problem. So, to address these performance issues, a backend dispatching mechanism was recently developed. In this talk, we will unveil this dispatching mechanism and its implementation details, and how we can use it just by specifying a `backend` kwarg like this:\r\n\r\n    >>> nx.betweenness_centrality(G, backend=\u201cparallel\u201d)\r\n\r\nor by passing the backend graph object(type-based dispatching):\r\n\r\n    >>> H = nxp.ParallelGraph(G)\r\n    >>> nx.betweenness_centrality(H)\r\n\r\nWe'll also go over the limitations of this dispatch mechanism. Ending with a brief overview of how this API dispatch mechanism could be integrated in other scientific Python libraries, along with the potential challenges that may arise with them.",
            "description": "In the first few minutes, we will familiarize ourselves with the NetworkX library and graph analysis in general. Moving on to a quick demo of the performance limitations of existing NetworkX algorithms such as `betweenness_centrality` and `square_clustering` when applied to a larger [SNAP graph dataset](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/ca-HepTh.html), underscoring the critical necessity for more optimised implementations. Balancing this need for more efficient and faster algorithms with the core values of NetworkX-- to remain free from any external dependencies and to uphold its pure Python nature, led to the development of a new backend dispatching system in NetworkX.\r\n\r\nNext, we will understand what API dispatching is in a broader sense, what are `entry_points`, how NetworkX utilises them to discover the backend packages and then redirect the NetworkX function calls to the faster backend implementations. We will then delve into some of the details of the features a backend developer can utilise, like the usage of `NETWORKX_TEST_BACKEND` environment variable, the second `entry_point` for backend meta-data, the `backend_priority`, `can_run`, `should_run` etc. And a summary of other NetworkX backends and some future to-dos for NetworkX\u2019s dispatching.\r\n\r\nAfter that, we will understand how and when this API dispatching mechanism could be adopted by a scientific Python library, and what are some of the challenges that they might face during its integration. We will also go over some of the recent developments in integrating API dispatching in the scikit-image project and the challenges of integrating API dispatching in an array-based library. Finally, concluding with an interactive Q&A.\r\n\r\nIntended audience:\r\n- Contributors of Python libraries who are interested in offering their users faster algorithms without changing their codebase and the user-API much\r\n- People who work with large graph datasets\r\n- anyone interested in API dispatching, graphs or any of the above stuff :)\r\n\r\nSome basic knowledge of Python is expected; should know what objects and classes are.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you :)",

You'll leave with practical tips for transforming your Django projects into systems that can handle increased complexity.",
            "description": "Django's model-view-serializer framework is a powerful tool for building small to medium-sized applications quickly and efficiently. Its straightforward approach allows developers to create CRUD operations with minimal effort, making it an excellent choice for projects with clear and simple requirements. However, as applications grow in complexity and scale, developers often encounter several challenges that can hinder the application's maintainability and scalability.\r\nOne common issue is the scattering of database operations across the codebase. This pattern often leads to tightly coupled APIs and database models, making it difficult to isolate logic for individual testing and increasing the fragility of the application as it scales. As database logic becomes intertwined with business logic, maintaining and expanding the application becomes increasingly challenging.\r\nIn this talk, we will explore these common pitfalls through real-world examples and demonstrate how to refactor a Django application for improved scalability and maintainability. Using a webhook server app as a case study, we'll discuss how client-driven response customization can complicate the traditional model-view-serializer approach. We'll explore the limitations of handling complex serialization and response formatting within the view layer, which often results in bloated views that are hard to test and scale.\r\nTo address these challenges, we'll introduce concepts from Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and hexagonal architecture. By applying these principles, we can decouple the application's components, making it easier to manage and extend. We'll refactor the application using a builder pattern for payload formatting, ensuring that response structures are flexible yet maintainable. Additionally, we'll introduce an injected service layer and a repository layer, which separate concerns and allow for more targeted unit testing. This architecture not only improves testability but also enhances the application's ability to adapt to changing requirements.\r\nWe'll provide a clear before-and-after comparison, highlighting the benefits of this refactored approach. Attendees will learn how these changes can lead to cleaner, more scalable code that is easier to debug and maintain. We'll also discuss the balance between Django's simplicity and the need for more sophisticated architecture, helping developers decide when it's appropriate to adopt these patterns.\r\nBy the end of this session, attendees will gain practical insights into transforming their Django projects into robust systems capable of handling increased complexity. Whether you're a developer working on scaling an existing application or someone interested in learning more about advanced architectural patterns, this talk will provide valuable takeaways and actionable strategies for improving your Django applications.",

            "description": "Introduction\r\n------------\r\n\r\nThe healthcare industry faces a critical challenge: converting the vast quantities of unstructured clinical text generated daily into actionable insights. German clinical documents, in particular, demand specialized Natural Language Processing (NLP) solutions due to linguistic and regulatory complexities. My worl explores the intersection of generative Large Language Models (LLMs) and fine-tuned BERT models to address two core tasks: Clinical Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Medical Coding. These tasks are pivotal for enhancing patient care, streamlining medical billing, and advancing clinical research.\r\n\r\nThis research introduces innovative methodologies and evaluates their effectiveness in processing German clinical texts, focusing on three core elements:\r\n\r\n1.  Leveraging generative LLMs for rapid entity extraction with minimal training data.\r\n\r\n2.  Fine-tuning BERT-based models on domain-specific datasets for improved recall.\r\n\r\n3.  Combining synthetic data generation with model fine-tuning to enhance performance.\r\n\r\nThrough a detailed evaluation using the Berlin-T\u00fcbingen-Oncology Corpus (BRONCO), this work establishes benchmarks for Clinical NLP tasks in German and sets the stage for scalable and efficient applications in healthcare.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nChallenges in Clinical NLP for German Texts\r\n-------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nClinical texts present unique challenges, especially in the German language:\r\n\r\n1.  **Heterogeneous Data Sources**: Documents vary significantly in structure, style, and content, making uniform processing difficult.\r\n\r\n2.  **Domain-Specific Terminology**: Medical texts often use highly specialized terms, abbreviations, and shorthand, complicating entity recognition and standardization.\r\n\r\n3.  **Data Scarcity and Privacy**: German clinical datasets are limited due to strict data protection regulations, increasing the reliance on synthetic data and domain-specific models.\r\n\r\n4.  **Complex Entity Linking**: Mapping clinical entities to standardized medical codes, such as ICD, OPS, and ATC, requires precise contextual understanding.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nMethodologies Explored\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\n### 1\\. Generative LLMs for Clinical NER\r\n\r\nLLMs, such as Llama-3.1-70B, OpenBioLLM, and BioMistral, have demonstrated potential for zero-shot and few-shot learning, making them suitable for tasks with limited labeled data. In this work:\r\n\r\n-   Prompt engineering is employed to guide LLMs in identifying entities like diagnoses, medications, and treatments.\r\n\r\n-   Structured output generation in JSON format is implemented to simplify downstream processing.\r\n\r\n-   Error-handling mechanisms are developed to improve consistency, including replaying invalid responses and flagging ambiguous entities.\r\n\r\nThe results show that LLMs provide rapid and flexible solutions, but their performance varies by entity type. They excel in identifying medications and treatments but struggle with diagnosis-related terms, highlighting the need for fine-tuned models.\r\n\r\n### 2\\. Fine-Tuned BERT Models\r\n\r\nBuilding on previous research with medBERT.de, this study fine-tunes BERT-based models on the BRONCO dataset:\r\n\r\n-   The BERT models are trained to recognize entities in German clinical text, achieving superior recall for complex tasks.\r\n\r\n-   Fine-tuning parameters, such as learning rate and batch size, are optimized for clinical NLP tasks.\r\n\r\n-   The models' ability to process large text chunks in parallel enhances their efficiency compared to sequential LLM inference.\r\n\r\n### 3\\. Hybrid Approach: Synthetic Data for Model Augmentation\r\n\r\nA novel hybrid approach combines the strengths of LLMs and BERT models:\r\n\r\n-   Synthetic data is generated using LLMs with carefully designed prompts in the BIO tagging format.\r\n\r\n-   This synthetic data augments the BRONCO training set, improving BERT's performance by up to 4% in precision for diagnosis-related entities.\r\n\r\n-   The hybrid approach bridges the gap between generative and discriminative modeling, offering a robust solution for resource-constrained settings.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nKey Innovations\r\n---------------\r\n\r\n### Structured Output Generation\r\n\r\nTo ensure reliable and interpretable outputs from LLMs, structured JSON generation is enforced. This includes:\r\n\r\n-   Defining strict schemas for entity recognition.\r\n\r\n-   Utilizing Python's Pydantic library for schema validation and error handling.\r\n\r\n-   Implementing fallback strategies for invalid or incomplete responses.\r\n\r\n### Synthetic Data Generation\r\n\r\nSynthetic data addresses the scarcity of annotated clinical datasets. By:\r\n\r\n-   Generating diverse and high-quality examples tailored to the target domain.\r\n\r\n-   Enhancing model generalization and robustness.\r\n\r\n### Entity Linking with Cross-Encoders\r\n\r\nA critical aspect of this research is Clinical Entity Linking, mapping extracted entities to medical codes (ICD, OPS, ATC). The xMEN framework is fine-tuned with domain-specific encoders, achieving high precision and recall in medical coding tasks.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nEvaluation and Results\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\n### Performance Metrics\r\n\r\nThe models are evaluated on precision, recall, and F1-score across three entity types:\r\n\r\n1.  **Diagnoses**\r\n\r\n2.  **Medications**\r\n\r\n3.  **Treatments**\r\n\r\nKey findings include:\r\n\r\n-   Generative LLMs achieve precision rates of up to 88.4% for medications but underperform in diagnosis recognition.\r\n\r\n-   Fine-tuned BERT models excel in recall, particularly for complex entities.\r\n\r\n-   The hybrid approach improves overall F1-scores, demonstrating the synergy of combining LLMs with fine-tuned models.\r\n\r\n### Computational Efficiency\r\n\r\nInference speed and resource utilization are also analyzed:\r\n\r\n-   LLMs offer flexibility but require significant computational resources.\r\n\r\n-   BERT models, once fine-tuned, provide faster and more resource-efficient solutions for large-scale deployments.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nPractical Implications and Future Directions\r\n--------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n### Enhancing Healthcare Delivery\r\n\r\nBy improving the accuracy and efficiency of Clinical NLP tasks, this research has direct applications in:\r\n\r\n-   Automated medical coding for billing and insurance.\r\n\r\n-   Clinical decision support systems.\r\n\r\n-   Patient safety and adverse event monitoring.\r\n\r\n### Advancing AI in Healthcare\r\n\r\nThe findings highlight the need for:\r\n\r\n-   Developing specialized LLMs for medical applications.\r\n\r\n-   Expanding synthetic data generation techniques to other low-resource domains.\r\n\r\n-   Improving entity linking frameworks for multilingual healthcare data.\r\n\r\n### Open Challenges\r\n\r\nWhile promising, the research identifies several areas for improvement:\r\n\r\n-   Balancing precision and recall across diverse entity types.\r\n\r\n-   Reducing computational overhead for real-time applications.\r\n\r\n-   Addressing ethical considerations in using synthetic data and AI-generated insights.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThis work underscores the transformative potential of integrating LLMs and BERT models for Clinical NLP in German healthcare. By addressing challenges in data scarcity, domain adaptation, and computational efficiency, it sets a foundation for scalable and impactful AI solutions in the medical domain. Through innovative methodologies and rigorous evaluation, this research contributes to advancing healthcare delivery and NLP research, fostering a future where AI seamlessly integrates into clinical practice.",

While useful in many applications, LLMs can also be used for harmful purposes such as spreading disinformation, automating spam, and fostering plagiarism. This can negatively impact the reputation of companies and undermine the trust of users. To mitigate these risks, various detection methods have been proposed to determine whether a text is created by a machine or a human. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will discuss differences between AI-generated and human-written texts. Next, we will overview state-of-the-art AI text detectors and discuss their differences, limitations, and empirical performance. We will analyze how detection performance changes depending on the text domain, information available to the detector, prompt complexity, and other factors. Finally, we will also touch on approaches to evade detectors, such as paraphrasing and spoofing.",
            "description": "Recent advancements in natural language processing have led to the development of large language\r\nmodels (LLMs) capable of generating highly coherent and contextually appropriate text. The rapid growth in the volume and quality of AI-generated content emphasizes the need for robust detection systems to prevent misuse of these technologies in dangerous applications such as misinformation propagation, phishing, and academic dishonesty. Accurately identifying AI-generated text is equally crucial in various business applications, including moderating online content, assessing the news trustworthiness and classifying product reviews.\r\n\r\nThe ability to accurately detect AI-generated text is especially critical for businesses that have a variety of customer-facing products where users can misuse LLMs. For instance, users of e-commerce businesses may suffer from product listings containing generic texts generated by a language model, e.g., \u00abI cannot fulfill that request, it goes against our current policy\u00bb. This makes listings look unprofessional and leads to poor user experience. Likewise, online product reviews have a high likelihood of being generated by an LLM, which undermines the trust for the platform and can be seen as irrelevant by customers. While some organizations can proactively ask users to disclose whether the AI-generated text was used in their content submission, many business use cases still lack trustworthiness and require additional moderation systems that could reliably identify such texts on a massive scale.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will focus on the topic of AI text detectors and discuss possible approaches and their performance in various settings. Our goal is to provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of existing detectors and propose potential future directions to mitigate the misuse of LLMs in business applications.

            "description": "### **1. Setting the Stage: Local vs. Distributed Storage (5 minutes)**  \r\n- **What\u2019s the Big Deal with Storage?**  \r\n  - First, let\u2019s talk about the shift from local storage (where we keep files on our own machines) to cloud-native storage (where data is spread across servers in the cloud).  \r\n  - This shift is awsome but comes with new challenges: distributed systems can be tricky to work with, especially when you need to access them in a consistant way.  \r\n\r\n### **2. Enter fsspec: A Game Changer for File Systems (10 minutes)**  \r\n- **What is fsspec?**  \r\n  - fsspec is a Python library that makes working with any kind of file system\u2014whether it's local, in the cloud, or on a distributed system\u2014much easier.  \r\n  - It does this by giving us a unified way to interact with storage, no matter where the files actaully live.  \r\n\r\n- **Why is fsspec Awesome?**  \r\n  - It simplifies file operations (like opening and reading files) across different storage systems, saving us time and mental enery.  \r\n  - Plus, it\u2019s open-source, which means you can extend it and make it work for your own unique storage setup.  \r\n\r\n### **3. fsspec in Action: How It Works with Popular Python Tools (15 minutes)**  \r\n\r\n#### **A. Using fsspec with Pandas**  \r\n- **Pandas & fsspec:**  \r\n  - If you work with Pandas, you\u2019re probably familiar with loading and saving data. fsspec helps make this process smoother by letting you pull data from cloud storage (like AWS S3) with no fuss.  \r\n  - We\u2019ll see how this works in practise, making it easy to work with large datasets in the cloud. \r\n\r\n#### **B. Using fsspec with TensorFlow**  \r\n- **TensorFlow & fsspec:**  \r\n  - If you\u2019re building machine learning models, TensorFlow needs to access training data and models, sometimes stored in the cloud.  \r\n  - With fsspec, TensorFlow can seamlessly interact with cloud storage, making your ML pipelines more streamlined and less frustraiting.  \r\n\r\n#### **C. Using fsspec with PyArrow**  \r\n- **PyArrow & fsspec:**  \r\n  - PyArrow is great for high-performance data processing. When working with big data files like Parquet, fsspec makes it easy to load and save them from cloud storage without missing a beat.  \r\n\r\n### **4. Extending fsspec: Building Your Own Solutions (5 minutes)**  \r\n- **What if I Need Something Custom?**  \r\n  - Sometimes, you need to work with storage systems that aren\u2019t \u201cout of the box.\u201d The cool part about fsspec is that it\u2019s highly extensible.  \r\n  - I\u2019ll walk through how you can easily extend fsspec to work with your own custom storage systems, using a real-world example of how we did this.  \r\n\r\n### **5. Wrap-Up & Key Takeaways (5 minutes)**  \r\n- **The Big Picture:**  \r\n  - fsspec is a simple yet powerful tool for making cloud-native storage work seamlessly with Python data tools like Pandas, TensorFlow, and PyArrow.  \r\n  - It\u2019s the tool you didn\u2019t know you needed to simplify your cloud storage tasks.  \r\n\r\n- **Final Thought:**  \r\n  - With fsspec, working with distributed storage doesn\u2019t have to be hard. It makes everything feel like you\u2019re working with local files, even when they\u2019re scattered across the cloud.  \r\n\r\n### **6. Q&A Session (5 minutes)**",

Yet, most applications still rely on simple, pairwise embedding comparisons. In this talk, I will introduce a straightforward convex optimization approach that leverages the \u201cmeaning compositionality\u201d property of embeddings to perform explainable inferences over sets of embeddings. This method goes beyond one-to-one similarity checks to determine, for example, whether one embedding is implied by a collection of others. Such inference capabilities can enhance re-ranking processes by removing redundancy, and they can also improve content-based recommendation systems. On a practical level, this technique is readily implementable using tools like the CVXPY library, which typically solves these problems with sub-second latency, even when dealing with hundreds of embeddings.\r\nIn sum, convex-optimization can provide NLP practitioners with an additional lightweight method to achieve explainable inferences in production systems.",

I will demonstrate how mapping these flexible general feature comparisons to a convex optimization problem offers a powerful solution\u2014one that can be readily implemented in Python using the well-known CVXPY library.\r\n\r\nTo help attendees fully grasp this approach, I will introduce the basics of embeddings and explain how meaning compositionality in embedding spaces allows for arithmetic reasoning. I will also provide a concise overview of convex optimization and how it can enhance the afore-mentioned reasoning.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I will introduce a second use case of the same convex problem: finding non-redundant decompositions in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines. By applying this method, we can ensure more diverse sets of retrieved information.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the talk, attendees will have a foundational understanding of how convex optimization can enhance NLP pipelines.",

            "description": "1. Introduction\r\nIn this session, I will talk about how we can create unit tests for PySpark applications using Python unittest and pytest libraries. Before jumping into the topic, it makes sense to talk briefly about what testing is in Software Development, what types of tests exist, what unit testing is and why it is even needed?\r\n\r\n2. What is Testing in Software Development?\r\nTesting in software development refers to the process of evaluating and verifying that a software program or application works as intended. It\u2019s a crucial step in the software development life cycle, ensuring that the software meets specified requirements and is free of defects or bugs that could adversely impact its performance, reliability or security.\r\n\r\nIn this session, I won\u2019t go into details of the benefits of testing and Test Driven Development (TDD). But as a data engineer/data scientist/ML engineer (i.e., data person) you should care about the quality of the software you are building. However, I will still briefly talk about the importance of unit testing below.\r\n\r\n2.1 What are the Test Types?\r\nThere are numerous types of tests in software development, each designed for a specific purpose and stage in the development process. The most commonly implemented test types are:\r\n\r\nUnit Testing: These are the smallest tests which validate that an individual component (e.g., function) of the software works as intended. That\u2019s why it is expected to run the unit tests in the Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline such as after each commit or when a PR is opened depending on your DevOps workflow.\r\n\r\nIntegration Testing: These tests check if multiple components work well together. The number of integration tests is less than unit tests but higher than E2E tests. They also take longer to execute than unit tests but take less time than E2E tests. Integration tests can also be included in the CI pipeline (e.g., when PR opened into develop and/or master). Since the decision of when to run which test and which branch strategy to use are DevOps-related topics, I won\u2019t dive into this topic for now.\r\nEnd-to-End Testing: Checks the application flow from beginning to end making sure that everything works well. This is very costly and most of the time done manually (especially at the beginning of the development) in the data engineering world. It is also possible to automate E2E tests but the execution time will still be much longer than other types of tests. Be aware that, in the Web and Mobile Development contexts E2E testing is different where the goal is to simulate real user actions using various tools.\r\n\r\n2.2 Understanding Unit Testing and Its Importance\r\nUnit testing is one of the foundational aspects of software development. At its core, a unit test is a piece of code written to test a specific function or module in isolation from other parts of the application. The primary goal is to validate each unit (e.g., a function).\r\n\r\n2.3 What are the Purposes of the unittest and pytest Libraries?\r\n\r\nunittest is a built-in Python testing library that follows the xUnit style and provides a test framework along with test discovery.\r\npytest is a popular third-party testing library for Python that offers a flexible and concise way to write tests.\r\n\r\nDemo time.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.4 How Can I Execute These Tests?\r\nDemo time.\r\n\r\n2.5 Summary and Comparison\r\nCompare the advantages and disadvantages of pytest and unittest libraries\r\n\r\n3. Conclusion\r\nThis was an introduction to testing in software development and in particular unit testing for PySpark applications. Of course, there are many more details to be covered such as mocking, pytest plugins, pytest conftest.py which is used for sharing fixtures across multiple files etc\u2026Please let me know if you are interested in more advanced topics and I will try to cover these.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, both libraries are great for developing unit tests for PySpark applications and in general for Python applications. You should choose depending on your needs and familiarity in both tools. If you are just starting with unit testing in Python, I would personally recommend to start with the unittest library first, especially if you already have experience with JUnit. Then move to pytest once you feel more comfortable.",

            "description": "NeuroAI is an emerging area of research into the fundamental principles of cognition and intelligence shared by living organisms and AI. Most significant developments in the history of AI have been inspired by biology; there are still many systems and properties of the brain that are yet to be replicated in AI algorithms. There continues to be a large conceptual gap between brains and machine learning models. The brain forms abstractions and learns continuously within a single life-time, while machine learning has focused on large data-sets and static function approximation. How can this gap be bridged?\r\n\r\nDespite the recent commercial success of large language models; these models are still brittle and resource hungry. While creating something with the capabilities of an LLM is impressive, reaching this point required training on dumps of the entire internet and whole libraries of books; even then progress has slowed as the \"fossil fuel\" of text written by humans is exhausted.\r\n\r\nThe bridge between AI and neuroscience is once again a promising path to walk. Understanding and then replicating the brain's ability to learn rapidly, flexibly and to create abstractions is as exciting and important as ever. This talk introduces the field of NeuroAI, discusses the upcoming challenges in the field, explores the intriguing and exciting successes and reflects on how this approach will shape the future of AI.",

            "abstract": "When I was hired as a Scientist for Machine Learning, experts said ML would never work in weather forecasting. Nowadays, I get to contribute to Anemoi, a full-featured ML weather forecasting framework used by international weather agencies to research, build, and scale AI weather forecasting models. \r\n\r\nThe project started out as a curiosity by my colleagues and soon scaled as a result of its initial success. As machine learning stories go, this is a story of change, adaptation and making things work. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, I'll share some practical lessons: how we evolved from a mono-package with four people working on it to multiple open-source packages with 40+ internal and external collaborators. Specifically, how we managed the explosion of over 300 config options without losing all of our sanity, building a separation of packages that works for both researchers and operations teams, as well as CI/CD and testing that constrains how many bugs we can introduce in a given day. You'll learn concrete patterns for growing Python packaging for ML systems, and balancing research flexibility with production stability. As a bonus, I'll sprinkle in anecdotes where LLMs like chatGPT and Copilot massively failed at facilitating this evolution.\r\n\r\nJoin me for a deep dive into the real challenges of scaling ML systems - where the weather may be hard to predict, but our code doesn't have to be.",
            "description": "What does it take to go from \"ML will never work in weather forecasting\" to running AI models in production at weather agencies? This talk chronicles the journey of Anemoi, a framework that evolved from research code to an operational ML weather forecasting system - and the technical challenges we faced along the way.\r\n\r\nStarting as experimental code and notebooks by a small team of four, Anemoi grew into a robust ecosystem supporting 40+ developers across multiple international weather agencies. I'll share our experience of scaling both the team and codebase, including the interesting challenge of conducting weekly code tours for new team members while maintaining development velocity.\r\n\r\nThe technical evolution of Anemoi mirrors many challenges in scaling ML systems. We'll explore how the codebase transformed from research artifacts and notebooks into a structured mono-package with proper separation of concerns. Then, how we split this into an ecosystem of specialized packages - only to later realize that some components were too tightly coupled and needed reunification. This journey offers valuable lessons about when to split packages and when to maintain unified codebases. \r\n\r\nConfiguration management evolved alongside our architecture. I'll demonstrate how we leveraged Hydra to tame over 300 configuration options into a hierarchical system that enables component composition without sacrificing usability. This system now powers everything from dataset creation to model inference, with full traceability of configurations and artifacts throughout the ML lifecycle.\r\n\r\nA unique aspect of developing ML systems at ECMWF is integrating with decades of expertise in weather forecast validation. We'll look at how we connected modern ML tooling like MLFlow with traditional meteorological evaluation systems, creating a bridge between ML innovation and established meteorological practices.\r\n\r\nThe talk will cover practical challenges that every growing ML system faces:\r\n\r\n- Making model components truly configurable and replaceable\r\n- Implementing model sharding for global weather predictions\r\n- Supporting flexible grids for regional weather services\r\n- Managing CI/CD across multiple packages\r\n- Streamlining release processes with modern tools\r\n- The eternal struggle with changelog management\r\n\r\nThroughout the presentation, I'll share real examples of what worked, what didn't, and why - including our experiments with AI coding assistants and where they fell short. You'll walk away with concrete patterns for scaling Python ML systems, strategies for managing growing complexity, and insights into balancing research flexibility with production requirements.\r\n\r\nWhether you're scaling an ML system, managing a growing Python codebase, or interested in how weather forecasting is being transformed by AI, this talk offers practical lessons from the frontier of operational ML systems.",

The bill goes down a bit and the process repeats again. \r\n\r\nThere can be more formal processes put in place for cost reduction and control (details of those.)\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is the cost of the different pipeline architectures\r\n\r\nCharges for cloud SaaS are more concealed than raw Cloud PaaS. But it must be assessed too, and they have some interesting pricing. For example if your data pipeline is open source and public, Github workflows are free! If it is private they charge twice as much for compute as using direct Azure. \r\nSimilarly cloud pipeline providers are big in this space, but how does Astronomy SaaS pricing stack up vs. running yourself on cloud PaaS\r\n\r\n### What pipeline design principles can we derive from this case?\r\n\r\n### Conclusion and summing up",

Proficiency in its use is a core skill across nearly all professions and is becoming increasingly important for Artificial Intelligence. But can Large Action Models (LAMs) autonomously operate a browser? What exactly are LAMs that promise to translate human intentions into actions? We report on a project that fully automates the job application process using AI: from navigating unfamiliar website structures and filling out forms to handling document uploads and cookie banners.",
            "description": "Large Action Models (LAMs) were first introduced by Rabbit with the launch of their R1 device, aiming to create end-to-end trained models that automatically translate human instructions into actions. Since then, the definition of LAMs has evolved to encompass Large Language Models (LLMs) utilized in multi-agent settings. Notable examples include Anthropic's \"Computer Use\" feature in their Claude model and Google's Project Mariner. These projects allow LLMs to operate a web browser or computer in a human-like manner by viewing the screen, moving the cursor, clicking buttons, and typing text, thereby fulfilling the original promise of LAMs by effectively translating human instructions into automated actions.\r\n\r\nWe present an innovative application of LAMs that automates the job application process using AI. Our system autonomously navigates unfamiliar website structures, fills out forms, handles document uploads, and manages cookie banners without human intervention. This level of automation streamlines the application process for job seekers while ensuring accurate and timely submissions.\r\n\r\nTo achieve this, we leveraged the LaVague framework, which employs a modular, agent-based approach:\r\n\r\n1.\t**Coordinator Agent:** A central agent powered by a multimodal model coordinates the entire process. It has access to website visuals, user data (e.g., personal details, CV information), previous instructions, and the overall objective. Based on this information, it delegates tasks to specialized agents.\r\n2.\t**Navigation Control Agent:** For simple website navigation, this agent utilizes a browser driver such as Selenium to directly interact (e.g., scroll) with the webpage.\r\n3.\t**Knowledge Agent:** When additional information is required, this agent performs knowledge-intensive tasks using an LLM. Examples include researching specific details or restructuring CV data.\r\n4.\t**Navigation Engine Agent:** For complex website interactions like inputting values or uploading files, this agent generates custom code for the browser driver. Using an LLM with access to the HTML code, it creates the necessary commands.\r\n\r\nThese agents work iteratively, performing tasks step by step until either the objective is achieved, or a maximum number of steps is reached.\r\n\r\nBy building a custom solution around the LaVague framework tailored specifically for the job application process, we successfully automated the entire workflow. In our presentation, we discuss our overall architecture, the challenges encountered during development and share valuable lessons learned for practical adoption.\r\n\r\nLarge Action Models like these highlight the transformative potential of AI in automating intricate tasks, bridging the gap between understanding human intentions and executing them in dynamic, real-world scenarios.",

            "abstract": "While LLMs steal all the thunder these days, classic NLP tasks - classification, NER, etc. - remain ubiquitous. Whether or not generative AI is involved, decomposing NLP applications into a series of modular, pipelined tasks is a widely used and effective software engineering pattern.\r\n\r\nGenerative and predictive zero-/few-shot (ZFS) models complement this approach by enabling rapid prototyping of NLP tasks with little to no data. However, they come with their own challenges:\r\n\r\n- **Generative models** CAN struggle to produce outputs in the required format, leading to the need for *structured generation*\u2014a set of methods designed to enforce or fine-tune generative models to precisely match the desired output structure.\r\n- **Predictive ZFS models**, while task-specific, typically lack generalization across different tasks.\r\n\r\nWhat does that mean for your friendly neighbourhood ML engineer, looking for the best way to quickly prototype a NLP pipeline? Structured generation remains an active area of research, and existing tools have varying strengths and limitations. Switching between them is not always straightforward, making the choice potentially a sticky one. Ideally, engineers need a flexible solution that supports rapid experimentation with minimal setup and sensible defaults to get started quickly.\r\n\r\nCue `sieves`: a toolkit for rapid prototyping of NLP tasks with ZFS models. It provides a unified interface for a variety of models, tasks, and methods for structured output generati",
            "description": "In NLP, implementing pipelines of established tasks is a common practice. Prototypes that require little to no data are often very valuable during early system development, as fully supervised models typically demand extensive annotated datasets. Generative and predictive zero-/few-shot learning models address this limitation by eliminating the immediate need for full annotation, enabling a \u201cwarm start\u201d over a \u201ccold start\u201d with fully supervised models. This approach accelerates development and enables faster feedback loops.\r\n\r\nDespite the richness of the open NLP ecosystem, there currently is no unified toolkit supporting rapid task prototyping without tight coupling to a specific (1) model, (2) structured generation library (e.g. https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy, https://github.com/dottxt-ai/outlines, https://github.com/1rgs/jsonformer, https://github.com/BoundaryML/baml) or (3) task. All three components should be as interchangeable as possible to improve on the developer experience and efficacy. `sieves` aims to fill this gap. \r\n\r\n### Agenda\r\n\r\nThis talk will cover the following topics:\r\n\r\n1. **The Value of Pipelines and Task Isolation**: Exploring their usefulness as abstractions, even when using generative models.\r\n2. **Warm Starts With Prototyping**: How to iterate effectively without relying on a training set.\r\n3. **Overview of Structured Generation Tools**: A summary of the current landscape in structured generation.\r\n4. **Introducing `sieves`**: Bringing it all together with pipelines, warm starts/prototyping, and structured generation.\r\n\r\nThe largest part of the presentation will focus on `sieves`, its core concepts, and its benefits:\r\n\r\n- **Loose coupling**: Decoupling models, tasks, and structured generation backends for flexibility.\r\n- **Unified format**: Standardized input/output formats across models, tasks, and structured generation backends.\r\n- **Generative and predictive ZFS support**: Compatibility with both approaches for versatility.\r\n- **Pipeline architecture**: Designed for maintainability and easy debugging.\r\n- **Comprehensive task support**: Prebuilt tasks for ZFS regimes, enabling single-line execution for tasks such as:\r\n    - Classification, NER, entity linking, REL, translation, etc.\r\n- **Auxiliary component integration**: Support for essential tools often needed in practical NLP workflows.\r\n- **Customizability**: Lightweight encapsulation of tasks, allowing users to easily customize or add new tasks.\r\n- **Supervised training support**: Enables compilation and export of training, validation, and test datasets in popular formats like Hugging Face\u2019s `datasets`.\r\n\r\n### Takeaways\r\n\r\nBy the end of this talk, attendees will understand:\r\n\r\n1. **The Benefits of Pipelines and Prototyping For Warm Starts**: How pipelines and warm starts - leveraging prototypes with ZFS techniques - can speed up the development of NLP applications, also when using generative models.\r\n2. **The Role of Structured Generation**: Insights into the current state of structured generation for text models and its impact on task implementation.\r\n3. **Contributions of `sieves`**: The place of `sieve` in the NLP ecosystem and how it contributes to a smoother and more productive developer experience in building out NLP applications by simplifying prototyping and accelerating development.",

            "description": "How on earth can you manage the lives of other people if you struggle managing your own? With that logic, I ruled myself out of management for years. Then I took a leap and became an engineering manager. And you know what? I realised I was good at it. And whilst my ADHD will always ensure I play life on hard-mode (and management is no different), I was surprised at the ways my past experiences, my quirks, my traumas and all the eccentricities bundled into my messy brain were in fact the reasons I succeeded as a manager. \r\n\r\nIn this whirlwind tour of my three years so far as an EM, I\u2019ll knit together a series of lessons I learnt (sometimes very difficult ones), I\u2019ll sprinkle a dusting of practical advice you won\u2019t find in neurotypical management books, and I\u2019ll cover a few of the areas and weaknesses in which I still struggle and how I\u2019m working on them.\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t worry, this won\u2019t be one of those \u201cADHD can be your superpower\u201d talks. But I hope my experiences as a neurodivergent Engineering Manager during one of the most turbulent periods in tech in recent history will at least banish the thoughts in your head that you could never do it.

I am extremely insistent right from the outset of all my talks on this topic that I am not a doctor and that people should obtain medical advice from a professional. I'm also very clear that my experiences are not necessarily the same as others - although I'm a queer neurodivergent person I'm also a cis white male, and there are other voices that encounter very different challenges in the neurodivergent sphere.\r\n\r\nAlthough I appreciate this is the diversity track of the conference, some of the more practical advice will feature how I used Python excessively as an EM - especially when it comes to productivity, automations and data (e.g. DORA metrics). It won't suddenly become a coding tutorial, but it'll at least have that relevant angle to many of your attendees. ;)\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to get in touch if you have any questions or concerns, and thanks for taking the time to read this!",

            "abstract": "In the data science field, we use all these powerful methods to solve important problems. Most of the time, we do this very well because our data science and machine-learning toolbox fits the problems we tackle quite precisely. Yet, what about our everyday choices or even our most important life decisions? Can we use for our private lives what we advocate for in our jobs or are these choices inherently different?\r\nMany of this real life decisions are a little different than textbook machine-learning problems. There is often less or hard-to-come-by data and the decisions are infrequent, but sometimes very consequential. This talk will dive into what makes everyday decisions difficult to handle with our data science toolbox. It will show how Bayesian thinking can help to reason in such cases, especially when there is not a lot of data to rely on.",
            "description": "In this talk, I want to have a look on decision making from a slightly different angle. In a world that produces an ever growing amount of data in every domain, data scientists can shine with their tools to make data-driven decisions. Often there is even too much data and the most tedious part of the work is to remove the noise from the signal with clever feature engineering. Though the world gets covered more and more by big data, this development is not distributed evenly.\r\n\r\nLots of decisions we need to make in real life do not follow this pattern. In fact, there are often surprisingly few data points that help us here. Yet, are there fundamental differences between everyday decisions and the type of decisions we automate so well with machine learning in our jobs? In this part of the talk, I will attempt a characterisation of both types of decisions. We will have a closer look at what implicit assumptions we make to use our machine learning toolbox. After this we might get a first explanation why these tools might be unsuited to answer questions like \u2019how longe should I study for an exam\u2019 or \u201a\u2019should I  accept this new job or not\u2019.\r\n\r\nEnter Bayesian statistics: This part of the talk will introduce Bayesian statistics for beginners using simple examples and images. It will highlight the benefits of the method when we are short of data but have some additional experience not encoded in the data. I will show how in these circumstances prior distributions come in really handy.\r\n\r\nAfter laying the groundwork on Bayesian methods we will circle back to the everyday decisions and see how well both things fit together. On a higher level, this will show what makes problems in decision making a great fit for Bayesian methods. I will introduce this using a practical example. The example will deal with the decision how long one should study for a test or exam. Taking a step-by-step approach, we explore how this decision can be informed with just a few data points. Set aside finding the key to successful exam preparation, the example is also helpful to see some of the basics for working with the pymc library.\r\n\r\nThe talk will end with some more general thoughts. This will answer where to go from here and for which decisions a thorough investigation like the presented one is worthwhile.,Yet, once one is familiar with the basics of Bayesian thinking, there might be shortcuts. I will show that we can use the principles as a great tool to improve discussions about important decisions on a broader scale.",

In this session, we will dive deep into a real-world use case of menu digitalization, where we encounter files with large volumes and diverse formats. These features lead to significantly increased complexity, especially when we aim at returning structured data, if we use traditional text extraction methods. We present an end-to-end solution that is not only suitable for batch process, but also for individual usage from end users. \r\n\r\nIn our solution, we leverage Google DocumentAI to extract critical information from menus, including menu item names, prices, volumes, descriptions and allergy info. The response from DocumentAI can be easily transferred into relational data. Beyond extraction, we employ Gemini to enhance the digitalized content by grouping the extracted data. This enables us to gain valuable info beyond menu itself for seamless usability. \r\n\r\nThe session will provide a step-by-step walkthrough of the entire workflow, highlighting how Python-based tools and frameworks power the implementation. We will discuss: \r\n1. How to set up and use Google DocumentAI for document data extraction. \r\n2. Techniques to clean, structure, and validate the extracted data for accuracy and usability. \r\n3. How Gemini contributes to grouping and enhancing the digitalized content, making it ready for applications such as POS (Point of Sale) onboarding. \r\n\r\nWe will also share the challenges faced during the process, such as handling inconsistent document formats and ensuring reliable outputs, along with the strategies we used to overcome them. The talk will include practical demonstrations of key Python libraries and tools used to build this end-to-end solution, ensuring attendees gain actionable knowledge to tackle their own document-processing challenges. \r\nBy the end of this session, we hope that attendees will: \r\n1.

            "description": "Why do companies struggle so hard to get their AI skills into production quickly?\r\n\r\nThis talk is about building an SDK that enables the development of production-ready AI skills in Python that can be run as serverless functions within a WASM runtime and interact with LLMs via a WIT (WASM Interface Type) world. On a less technical note, we will explore the design of an SDK that offers a streamlined development experience for AI skills.\r\n\r\nWe will explore the implications for topics such as testability, traceability, and the evaluation of AI logic. How can software engineering best practices, such as separation of concerns and modularity, be applied to the design of AI applications?\r\n\r\nFred Brooks' excellent essay, _No Silver Bullet,_ distinguishes between accidental complexity and essential complexity. This talk will explore how an SDK for AI skills can reduce accidental complexity during development and deployment, providing developers with a focused environment for innovating prompts and retrieval strategies.\r\n\r\nHow can a WIT that supports running AI applications be designed, and how can bindings to such a WIT world be generated and consumed in a Python module? We will examine abstractions that allow local testing and debugging without the compilation step by encapsulating the WIT host interface behind a `Protocol`.\r\n\r\nThe talk also covers benefits of running AI skills as WASM components: When compiling a Python module to a component, the Python interpreter is part of the compiled component. Although this results in longer start-up times compared to components written in compiled languages like Rust, it provides a key advantage: The interpreter can securely execute Python code generated by an LLM within a highly restricted environment, ensuring no network or file system access.\r\n\r\nKey takeaways include developing a foundational understanding of WASM and WIT, and how they can interface with Python. You will gain insights into the challenges of deploying AI skills into production and discover how testing, tracing, and evaluation can simplify this process.",

            "description": "What it means to \"work in/with AI\" and the corresponding roles, tasks, and required skills have been ambiguous since the emergence of AI professionals in industry. And while the demand for AI-skilled professionals continues to grow, both organizations and individuals seeking to work in the AI field often struggle with two challenges: 1) clearly defining the competencies and responsibilities that positions and projects require, and 2) identifying appropriate upskilling opportunities to match these needs.\r\nThe urgency to upskill professionals in AI topics has not only become more nuanced since the emergence of generative AI but is also growing rapidly. This trend is further amplified by the upcoming European AI Act, which will soon require companies to \"ensure, to their best extent, a sufficient level of AI literacy among their staff.\" This regulation has created an urgent need to define and understand what constitutes AI literacy and AI skills in practical terms.\r\n\r\nTo help organizations and professionals navigate this landscape, we have developed a comprehensive framework categorizing AI skills into distinct domains spanning technical competencies, regulatory knowledge, AI strategy, and ecosystem understanding. Our framework, developed by the multidisciplinary team of AI experts in the appliedAI Institute for Europe, provides a structured approach to defining skill requirements, guiding career development, identifying training gaps, and helping educational providers align their offerings with market demands.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, we will introduce our framework and share initial data reflecting the current state of AI skills levels and upskilling needs across a sample of companies. We will also discuss practical strategies for implementing this AI Skills framework within organizations, enabling them to better assess, develop, and acquire the AI capabilities they need to fulfill their specific needs.",

However, a lot of times the value actually provided stays well below the initial expectations. When looking into use cases where this was the case, we found the following: \r\n\r\n1. A lot of times, people tried generic solutions like Microsoft Copilot which simply lack the customizability needed to seamlessly support the workflow. \r\n2. Other times, people aim at building a custom solution but neglect the importance of providing a suitable user interface for leveraging the new technology. \r\n\r\nBoth of those cases can be caused by a variety of different factors. One could for example be overestimating the abilities of LLMs and thus neglecting the importance of providing transparency in the decision-making process. Another one could also be simply not having the abilities for implementing a user interface themselves together with the lack of tooling that focuses on the user interface aspect. \r\n\r\nThis is why we embrace the importance of Human-Centered Design for LLM powered systems, especially RAG systems. Concretely we have identified the following areas that we focus on when designing RAG systems that provide value to their users and are safe to use: \r\n\r\n1. Balancing Human and Machine Intelligence in RAG Systems: Provide effective but safe workflows through balancing user control and automation \r\n2. Building Trust Through Transparency and Explainability: Increase safety and build user trust through traceable decisions. \r\n3. Designing Intuitive and Usable Interfaces for Diverse Users: Reducing cognitive load and adapting to user needs. \r\n4. Feedback and Iteration Loops for Continuous Improvement: Refine your system over time and improve alignment with user expectations.\r\n\r\nIn the following sections we will thus outline those general themes, together with common pitfalls and patterns to follow. We also will provide guidance on how to leverage open-source tooling for concrete implementation of these principles. \r\n\r\n\r\nBalancing Human and Machine Intelligence in RAG Systems \r\n\r\nBeing able to find the right balance of automation and user control is critical for designing an effective RAG system. Simply providing a chat window where the user can interactively ask any question, he or she wants will often not be efficiently supporting the task at hand through lack of guidance and automation. On the other hand, simply automating the whole process will often also not work as the model will make mistakes which depending on the use case can be costly or even unacceptable. Thus, you should care about thinking deeply about what the LLM can provide you and what the user must bring to the table. Below you find our lists of pitfalls and patterns to follow to avoid this trouble: \r\n\r\n1. Deeply think about your users' use case and workflow! Also, iterate frequently, it is impossible to get is perfect the first time. \r\n2. Think about humans in the loop approaches early on. A lot of times, people are too focused on making the model a tiny bit more accurate although the much more effective solution is changing the way the model is used. \r\n3. Make the transitions between things the LLM does and things the human does as easy and transparent as possible. E.g., going out of an app and opening a file in a PDF viewer to verify some information is usually not the way to go. Also, the user should know what the LLM just did and be able to take over seamlessly. \r\n4. Provide sensible defaults for workflows and let experienced users override them if necessary. A lot of times you will need to cater to both. Trying to fit everything in one interface will make your app unusable and weaken the guidance your app can provide to a user. Thus, find sensible defaults than can be adapted by experts without distracting the ones that don\u2019t need the flexibility. \r\n\r\n\r\nBuilding Trust Through Transparency and Explainability \r\n\r\nLike also in other machine learning applications, a lot of the success of a machine learning system depends on being safe to use and building user trust. This is especially true for LLM-based systems as the fear and real risk of hallucinations is ubiquitous. Imagine having to make a decision in a business environment and simply trusting the aggregated answer of the LLM. This will not work, even in domains that are not especially high stakes. As a result, we have defined the following principles: \r\n\r\n1. Make it as easy as possible for the user to follow the decision-making process of the LLM. Even simple mechanisms like making the sources for an answer easily accessible can help already. \r\n2. Think about additional mechanisms that can further reduce cognitive load when interpreting a result, e.g., further narrow down the information used for generating an answer based on explainable AI techniques. \r\n3. Do not overwhelm the user with technical details in the explanations. Stay as close to the representations of information the user is used to and do not clutter the UI with additional elements. \r\n4. Provide granularity in explanations, meaning, first provide high-level summaries and let the user switch to detailed information on demand. \r\n\r\n\r\nDesigning Intuitive and Usable Interfaces for Diverse Users \r\n\r\nBesides providing transparency about what the model does there is also a component about simply making the application easy and fun to use. Users probably won\u2019t feel comfortable using an app where they feel they must do a lot of unnecessary actions.  One large part of this is really knowing the user, another part is having the technical ability to implement this using e.g. a front-end framework like React. In general, we propose to adhere to the following principles: \r\n\r\n1. Focus on tailoring your app to the user. Even tiny differences in the layout of the app or the way an action is dispatched can make a huge difference, especially in highly repetitive tasks. \r\n2. When creating a POC, be aware of that. If you can, incorporate thinking about suitable patterns for user interaction as soon as possible. If you cannot do that in a first iteration, at least explicitly outline how the app could be developed in a more usable direction. \r\n3. Use diverse methods for collecting feedback, such as having weekly meetings with real users, shadowing the users when doing their task using the new app, and many more. \r\n\r\n\r\nFeedback and Iteration Loops for Continuous Improvement \r\n\r\nAs mentioned in the previous section, feedback is key for developing your system in a direction where the users will be effective with it and like using it. This has many layers and can affect adapting the underlying machine learning model itself but also making changes to the user interface. A lot of times however, we see that this feedback loop is neglected, especially in POCs, claiming that dealing with this later will be fine. The problem with this is that often those POCs then fail to prove value and do not move on to be a production ready ML system. So, it is important to think about how you can try incorporating Feedback into your ML project. We on our side usually try to follow these principles: \r\n\r\n1. Gather feedback continuously to improve your system. This should be one of your main sources for prioritizing tasks. Otherwise, your development will be undirected, no matter if it is about UI or model improvements. \r\n2. Make giving feedback as easy as possible and be transparent about how you use the feedback. This will incentivize users to give you feedback in the first place. The best is to make them immediately feel the changes they can make with this. \r\n3. If possible, try to avoid clutter in the User Interface as much as possible and use non-explicit feedback signals as much as possible, e.g., if a user adapts sources manually after a query was answered then your system might have gotten the wrong sources. \r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion \r\n\r\nBeing human-centered when designing RAG systems is important. As described previously, although it seems like the natural language interface by itself makes the LLM technology really accessible to the user this is not necessarily the case. It is still important to actively push towards finding the right interfaces and workflows to be effective in implementing a solution for a specific problem. Cross-cutting principles like frequent iteration, or balancing automation and user control, as well as specific mechanisms like explainability techniques can thus help tremendously with developing a solution that really is helping people to fulfilling their tasks. We hope with this presentation we can raise awareness, as well as provide hands-on guidance on what to avoid and what to embrace when building your next RAG-based machine learning system.",

            "description": "In 2022 and 2023, explaining the inner workings of large language models (LLMs) seemed like a daunting task. However, recent studies in 2024 have led to significant breakthroughs in this area. This talk will explore three of the most important discoveries in LLM explainability.\r\n\r\n**1. Llamas \u201cThink\u201d in English [1]**\r\n\r\nResearchers from EPFL have revealed that models from the Llama 2 family of LLMs use English as their internal representation, regardless of the input or output language. This behaviour may account for certain biases in the models' style when used with non-English languages.\r\n\r\n**2. Monosemantic Features in Claude 3 and GPT-4 [2]**\r\n\r\nResearchers from Anthropic, later followed by OpenAI, have succeeded in collapsing the internal representation of Claude 3 Sonnet and GPT-4 into monosemantic features. This discovery enables a deeper understanding of which areas of the model are associated with specific topics and allows for the adjustment of the relative importance of these topics. This technique holds promise for aligning LLMs with ethical values.\r\n\r\n**3. LLMs Memorize Unusual Data [3]**\r\n\r\nRecent research has shown why LLMs tend to memorize specific samples that are outliers compared to the normal data distribution. Unique strings, such as names and personal information, are particularly prone to memorization and can be reproduced by the models, especially when exploring similarly unusual data spaces. This finding explains instances where GPT-4 have shared personal information when prompted to repeat the same word indefinitely.\r\n\r\nFinally, we will discuss the implications of these findings on privacy and security in the context of LLMs.\r\n\r\n**Time Split**\r\n\r\n**Talk Structure**\r\n\r\n- **0-5 mins:** Introduction - Why LLMs are challenging to explain\r\n- **5-10 mins:** Llamas \u201cthink\u201d in English\r\n- **10-20 mins:** Monosemantic features in Claude 3 and GPT-4\r\n- **20-25 mins:** LLMs Memorize Unusual Data\r\n\r\n**Resources**\r\n\r\n1.

This talk presents two advanced features of this next-generation dataframe library: **lazy queries** and **streaming mode**.\r\n\r\nLazy evaluation in Polars allows you to build complex data pipelines without the performance bottlenecks of eager execution. By deferring computation, Polars optimises your queries using techniques like **predicate and projection pushdown**, reducing unnecessary computations and memory overhead. This leads to significant performance improvements, particularly with datasets larger than your system\u2019s physical memory. For instance, if you need to filter a large CSV file based on certain criteria, Polars can push down the filter operation to the scan level, reading only the necessary rows from the file. This can drastically reduce the amount of data loaded into memory and speed up query execution.\r\n\r\nPolars' **`LazyFrame`s** form the foundation of the library\u2019s streaming mode, enabling **efficient streaming pipelines**, real-time transformations, and seamless integration with various data sinks. This means you can process data in chunks as it arrives, without having to load the entire dataset into memory **2**. Imagine building a real-time analytics dashboard that processes data from a Kafka stream, applying aggregations and transformations on the fly, and updating the dashboard with the latest insights. Polars' streaming mode makes this possible with minimal effort.\r\n\r\nThis session will explore use cases and technical implementations of both lazy queries and streaming mode. We\u2019ll also include **live-coding demonstrations** to introduce the tool, showcase best practices, and highlight common pitfalls.\r\n\r\nAttendees will walk away with practical knowledge of lazy queries and streaming mode, ready to apply these tools in their daily work as data engineers or data scientists.\r\n\r\n**Talk Outline**\r\n1. Introduction and motivation for lazy queries and streaming mode (5 mins)\r\n2. Lazy queries: discussion, implementation and live coding (10 mins)\r\n3. Streaming mode: implementation, main settings, most common issues, and live coding (10 mins)\r\n4. Q&A (5 mins)",

But what's truly unique about Roundnet is the opportunity it offers: as a new and emerging sport, we have the rare chance to shape its global rule changes entirely through data analysis. This is a groundbreaking approach \u2013 a first for any sport in the modern era.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I\u2019ll share insights from my role as Data Lead on the International Roundnet Rule Committee and take you through how we are leveraging Python and data analysis to guide these changes. Over the past year, we\u2019ve collected rule proposals and have set up a series of experiments designed to test their effects. Using Python and statistical modeling, we\u2019re planning to select key tournaments worldwide this year to observe how rule adjustments impact gameplay data.\r\n\r\nOur ultimate goal is to discover if specific combinations of rule changes can make Roundnet fairer, more exciting, and accessible for players and spectators alike. This journey is an exploration of how data-driven decision-making can transform a sport from the ground up, using real-world insights and experimentation.\r\n\r\nThis talk will take you on the journey of how we set up our testing framework, what tools we\u2019re using, and how we\u2019ve employed Python-powered analysis to bring empirical evidence into the decision-making process. It will equip you with a new perspective on data's role in shaping real-world change \u2013 especially in grassroots movements, community building, and sports.",

            "description": "The healthcare sector is uniquely positioned to benefit from AI agents due to its complex workflows, massive data requirements, and the need for timely, accurate decision-making. Here\u2019s how to get started:\r\n\r\nUnderstand the Role of AI Agents in Healthcare AI agents in healthcare can:\r\nAssist in diagnostics by analyzing patient data, medical images, and lab results. Enable clinical decision support through predictive analytics and evidence-based recommendations. Enhance patient engagement with virtual assistants for scheduling, symptom checks, or post-care follow-ups. Optimize administrative workflows like billing, coding, and claims management.\r\n\r\nIdentify a Problem to Solve Start by identifying a specific pain point. For example:\r\nReducing manual effort in medical data entry. Accelerating the diagnosis process with AI-powered imaging tools. Personalizing patient treatment plans using predictive modeling.\r\n\r\nLearn the Basics of AI for Healthcare Machine Learning (ML): Predict patient outcomes or recommend treatments based on historical data. Natural Language Processing (NLP): Extract insights from unstructured medical records or facilitate patient-agent conversations. Reinforcement Learning (RL): Optimize treatment pathways or resource allocation in hospitals. Familiarize yourself with healthcare-specific data challenges, such as privacy regulations (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR) and handling noisy, unstructured data.\r\n\r\nExplore AI Agent Frameworks and Tools LangChain: Ideal for building conversational agents that assist with patient inquiries or doctor consultations. Hugging Face Transformers: Use pre-trained models for medical text analysis. Healthcare-Specific Platforms: Look into tools like Google Health AI or IBM Watson Health for specialized healthcare applications.\r\n\r\nBuild Your First AI Agent Define the Scope: Start small with a single task, such as appointment scheduling or symptom checking. Prepare Data: Use publicly available datasets like MIMIC-III for training models, ensuring compliance with ethical standards. Choose Models: Pre-trained models or fine-tuned versions (e.g., BioBERT for medical NLP). Integrate with Systems: Connect the agent to existing EMRs or hospital systems via APIs.\r\n\r\nAddress Challenges in Healthcare AI Data Privacy and Security: Ensure compliance with regulations like HIPAA. Bias in Models: Validate models against diverse datasets to prevent biased outcomes. Interoperability: Ensure agents can communicate with multiple healthcare systems seamlessly.",

Explore why Python is our go-to language for data science and collaboration.",
            "description": "In this talk, I will share my journey with Python, spanning over 20 years, and how it has become an integral part of our work at E.ON. My experience with open source began over 30 years ago during my research as a Theoretical Particle Physicist, where sharing insights and code was a daily practice. Transitioning to a software developer role at a start-up, I initially used Perl for various tasks but soon realized the challenges of code readability and collaboration. Python, with its enforced indentation and readability, quickly became my language of choice.\r\n\r\nAt E.ON, Python is our go-to language for Data Science tasks. In our team we recently migrated another programming language codebase to Python to streamline our development framework and attract top talent. Python's straightforward modularization into packages and modules simplifies maintenance and lineage, especially in cloud-based pipelines, and helps prevent vendor lock-in. The robust toolchain for code quality checks, testing, and building packages makes Python a no-brainer for development and supports our MLOps principles.\r\n\r\nI will discuss how Python facilitates collaboration globally at E.ON and share examples of our MLOps principles in action. Highlights include image analysis projects like object detection with batch inferencing and instance segmentation with real-time inference endpoints. Additionally, I will detail E.ON's steps towards open-sourcing some of our codebases, enabling other energy companies to build on our projects.\r\n\r\nJoin me to explore why Python is not just a tool but a catalyst for innovation and collaboration at E.ON.",

            "description": "How do we measure abstract concepts, like attitudes toward politics or science, from vast amounts of unstructured text? This talk introduces domain-aware contextual representations, a novel method that leverages advanced natural language processing to detect and analyze complex ideas embedded in speech corpora. Unlike traditional approaches, which often rely on predefined measures, this technique adapts to the specific context of the data, making it possible to extract meaningful insights from political speeches, social media, or other forms of discourse.\r\n\r\nUsing domain-aware contextual representations, we can uncover subtle patterns in how political leaders talk about science, even when the concept itself is implicit or abstract. By incorporating domain-specific knowledge into the analysis, the method generates richer, more accurate representations of complex attitudes, such as how science is framed in terms of its role in society, its values, or its institutional importance.\r\n\r\nThis approach leverages open LLMs, like Mistral 7B and Llama 3, along with powerful Python libraries like SentenceTransformers, to build contextual embeddings that capture both the general linguistic context and the specific nuances of discourse of interest: science in this case. I will demonstrate how this method can be applied to a large dataset of political speeches, showing how different political regimes and leaders use science rhetoric in diverse ways. Early results highlight striking differences: autocratic leaders often focus more on the normative value of science, while democratic leaders emphasize its institutional role. The method also reveals how science discourse peaks in specific domains, such as healthcare and technology, during times of crisis.\r\n\r\nThis talk will showcase how domain-aware contextual representations, powered by open-source tools, open new possibilities for detecting and analyzing abstract concepts in text data, offering exciting opportunities for both researchers and practitioners working with large-scale text analysis in Python.",

Sustaining this welcoming environment requires intentional community-building efforts, which often involve repetitive or time-consuming tasks. These tasks, however, can be automated without compromising their value\u2014freeing up time for meaningful human engagement.\r\n\r\nThis talk showcases my project aimed at supporting underrepresented groups in tech, specifically through building Python communities on Mastodon and Bluesky. A key part of this initiative is the \"Awesome PyLadies\" repository, a curated collection of PyLadies blogs and YouTube channels that celebrates their work. To enhance visibility, I created a PyLadies bot for social media. This bot automates regular posts and reposts tagged content, significantly extending their reach and fostering an engaged community.\r\n\r\nIn this session, I\u2019ll cover:\r\n- The role of automation in community building\r\n- The technical architecture behind the bot\r\n- A hands-on demo on integrating Google\u2019s Gemini into community tools\r\n- Upcoming features and opportunities for collaboration\r\n\r\nBy combining Python, automation, and modern AI capabilities, we can create thriving, inclusive communities that scale impact while staying true to the human-centered ethos of open source.",

            "description": "## Who is this talk for\r\n\r\nThis talk is ideal for all software engineers interested in financial technology, quantitative developers looking to understand modern trading infrastructure, and technical architects exploring distributed systems in high-stakes environments.  \r\nThis talk will NOT discuss specific trading strategies or give any financial advice.\r\n\r\n## Outline\r\n\r\n* Motivation  \r\n* Fundamental trading concepts and market mechanics  \r\n* Market data ingestion and processing  \r\n* Order management and execution  \r\n* Implementation of trading strategies  \r\n* Post-trade analysis  \r\n* Outlook\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nThe landscape of financial trading has undergone a dramatic transformation over the past decades. What was once the exclusive domain of institutional players on physical trading floors has evolved into a digitized, accessible marketplace where individual traders can participate from anywhere in the world. The emergence of commission-free trading apps and cryptocurrency exchanges has brought market participation to millions of new retail traders.  \r\nThis enables everyone to participate with their own trading system in global markets.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we'll explore how you can implement your own distributed system for exchange trading leveraging the power of open source without being dependent on trading bot providers. While we won't be able to cover every aspect in depth, we'll address the most essential elements.\r\n\r\nCryptocurrency markets are used as a proving ground for the PoC due to easy availability for everyone.\r\n\r\n## Fundamental Trading Concepts and Market Mechanics\r\n\r\nWe'll begin by exploring essential trading concepts:\r\n\r\n* Order book dynamics  \r\n* Orders, Trades and Positions  \r\n* Different types of orders and their implications for system implementation  \r\n* Regulatory requirements  \r\n* Performance of strategies\r\n\r\nThese lead to different considerations in system design and architecture:\r\n\r\n* De-coupling of exchange interfaces and trading strategies to use same strategy for different markets by using adapter pattern  \r\n* Horizontal scaling to handle data load  \r\n* Need of low latency components and their communication to properly react to market  \r\n* Need of streaming data for real-time risk management  \r\n* Need of persistent storage for regulatory data and post-trading-analysis  \r\n* Need of order action recording and post-trading analysis for performance evaluation\r\n\r\n## Market Data Ingestion and Processing\r\n\r\nThe foundation of any trading system is its ability to efficiently process market data. This includes a Python component responsible for real-time normalization and standardization of multi-venue data:\r\n\r\n* Efficient market data representation and storage structures  \r\n* Techniques for handling high-throughput data without compromising latency  \r\n* Market data recording for post-trading analysis using Kafka\r\n\r\n## Order Management and Execution\r\n\r\nCritical components for managing the trading lifecycle. This includes a Python component responsible for normalization and standardization of multi-venue order interfaces:\r\n\r\n* Order action handling (placing orders, modifying orders) and keeping track of orders  \r\n* Global real-time position tracking and risk calculation using Kafka  \r\n* State recovery and system restart procedures  \r\n* Audit trail implementation and transaction logging using Postgres\r\n\r\n## Implementation of Trading Strategies\r\n\r\nWe'll explore the practical aspects of implementing trading strategies in Python using the previously discussed system components:\r\n\r\n* Usage of provided market data  \r\n* Placing orders and keeping track of positions  \r\n* Fast communication with market data and order components using gRPC  \r\n* Recording of strategy internals for post-trade analysis\r\n\r\n## Post-trade Analysis and Performance Monitoring\r\n\r\nWe will take a closer look to evaluate trading strategies performance with:\r\n\r\n* High-performance post-trade analytics using DuckDB  \r\n* Live performance monitoring using Kafka\r\n\r\n## Outlook\r\n\r\nAt the end we will have a brief outlook what other challenges might occur e.g.:\r\n\r\n* Other market types (Finance/Equity/ETF and Energy)  \r\n* Latency considerations  \r\n* Taxes",

            "abstract": "Our world is complex: one approach to understanding and learning more about relationships within the data is to represent it as a network or a graph - with entities as nodes and relations between them as edges. Network applications are abundant - Facebook, knowledge databases like Wikipedia, traffic routes, molecular pathways, and the fun starts when we start thinking of the physical world as graphs. Where there\u2019s data, there\u2019s uncertainty and the need to predict the future to make it a *little less* uncertain, which is why we need machine learning.\r\n\r\n**This talk will be about modeling one such network using a Graph Neural Network (GNN) and predicting on it using Deep Graph Library, an efficient and scalable open source framework to train and serve GNNs. While GNNs can be used for any ML task, we\u2019ll focus on building a recommendation model.**\r\n\r\nBut the transition from traditional data structures to graph-based models is not straightforward. Unlike tabular data, graphs require adapting ML principles to accommodate their topological and relational complexities. \r\n\r\n**This talk will help participants gain practical insights into modeling their data as graphs and leveraging GNNs to build a recommendation system - from scratch. We\u2019ll go over each ML model building step and discuss how to adapt our learnings from tabular data to graph data.**",
            "description": "This talk is to get the audience excited about graph ML and hopefully inspire them to think of their data as a potential graph which can open doors for this new paradigm of ML. Graphs are complex, but then again so is most of the data now.\r\n\r\nThe talk will be supported by code snippets and will be using an open source recommendation dataset. \r\n\r\n### Outline: \r\n\r\n**1. Intro to Graph Machine Learning** (6 minutes)\r\n- Brief overview of traditional data vs. graph-based data and graph components\r\n- Networks in real-life and relevance\r\n- ML on graphs: recent advancements\r\n\r\n**2.

            "description": "Talk Structure: \"Beyond Your ORM's Migration Tool\"\r\n\r\n1. Introduction \u2013 Why ORMs Build Migration Tools\r\n   - ORMs like SQLAlchemy and Django ORM simplify database interactions and include migration tools (e.g., Alembic, Django Migrations) for schema changes.\r\n   - These tools are robust for ORM-defined schemas but lack advanced features and native CI/CD integrations.\r\n\r\n2. Where Built-in Tools Fall Short\r\n   - ORM migration tools focus on basic schema changes but don\u2019t support advanced database objects like triggers, materialized views, or stored procedures.\r\n   - Lack native integration with modern CI/CD tools, leaving teams to implement custom, often suboptimal solutions.\r\n\r\n3. Presenting Atlas \u2013 Bridging the Gap\r\n   - Atlas complements ORM tools by reading their schemas (e.g., Django models, SQLAlchemy models) and enabling advanced extensions.\r\n   - Key features:\r\n     - Support for triggers, materialized views, and other advanced objects.\r\n     - Native CI/CD integration for automating and validating schema changes.\r\n\r\n4. How Atlas Integrates with ORMs\r\n   - Atlas reads ORM-defined schemas and enhances them with advanced features.\r\n   - Combines ORM workflows with Atlas\u2019s robust schema management capabilities, enabling automation and database-specific optimizations.\r\n\r\n5. Demo \u2013 Atlas in Action\r\n   - Example: A Django project adds a materialized view and a trigger using Atlas.\r\n   - Steps:\r\n     - Use Atlas to read the ORM schema and extend it with advanced features.\r\n     - Automate migration validation and deployment through CI/CD pipelines.\r\n   - Outcome: Simplified and automated schema management with modern tooling.\r\n\r\n6. Conclusion and Q&A\r\n   - Key Takeaways:\r\n     - ORM migration tools like Alembic and Django Migrations are great for standard use cases but fall short for advanced workflows and CI/CD integration.\r\n     - Atlas bridges this gap, enabling automation and advanced database features.\r\n   - Call to Action: Try Atlas to enhance schema workflows.\r\n   - Q&A: Open floor for questions.",

We also believe that it is probably fun to participate in this tutorial.",
            "description": "Games encourage people to put their brains to work in a focused, constructive and peaceful way. This makes games a fantastic tool in the classroom. Many board games contain sophisticated algorithms and statistical models right under the surface. Therefore, Data Science education can be boosted by playing carefully selected games.\r\n\r\nWe have applied popular board and card games such as Memory, Wizard, Machi Koro, Pandemic and Sky Team (the 2024 Game of the Year in Germany) to teach Data Science concepts in our courses. Learners would first play a game, discuss the mechanisms and only after that get exposed to the theory. Finally, they would move to practical applications using computers.\r\n\r\nThis game-driven approach provides learners with an intrinsic motivation to solve a real practical problem (succeeding at the game).\r\nAnalyzing a game makes it easier to grasp the core mechanism or algorithmic model and ask qualified questions about the details later.\r\nIt also makes sure learners will want to come back for the next class. We have documented practical lessons and made them available under a CC license on https://www.academis.eu/probably_fun/ .\r\n\r\nIn this tutorial, you will speed-date with several short games that can be used to teach Data Science concepts and skills. You will play one game for 15 minutes, reflect on the Data Science concepts it involves, and then rotate to the next table. \r\nThis way, you will experience multiple ideas you can use to make complex methods and ideas more accessible. Also, the tutorial is probably fun to participate in.\r\n\r\nThe tutorial will be executed according to the following pseudocode (or lesson plan):\r\n\r\n1. The presenters give a short introduction on why games matter (5 min)\r\n2. The presenters group participants into teams of up to 6 people.\r\n3. Each team is assigned to a game table with a game and a cheat sheet with instructions. The presenters facilitate with understanding rules and to remove other obstacles.\r\n4. The teams play the game for up to 15 minutes.\r\n5. The teams discuss 1-3 prepared reflection questions to make the transfer from the game to the data science concepts.\r\n6. Each team moves to the next table.\r\n7. Repeat for 3-4 rounds.\r\n8. Everybody gets together for a joint Q & A\r\n9.

By interweaving real and synthetic data, we demonstrate how practitioners can accelerate model customisation and reduce costs, even under severe data or budget constraints.\r\n\r\nIn addition to detailing the \"how\" of each method, we offer insights into why these adjustments matter for business impact, including guidelines for selecting methods based on domain complexity, data availability, and cost considerations. Attendees will leave with a concrete blueprint for using advanced LLM adaptations in their own projects, fully equipped to navigate the trade-offs between model performance, resource allocation, and regulatory compliance.\r\n\r\nOutline:\r\n\r\n1. Introduction: Why Adapting LLMs Matters\r\n1.1 Very often, adaptation is the only way an LLM can learn the complex and unique requirements of a specific business domain.\r\n1.2 Illustrate how domain specialization can reduce risk, drive innovation, and improve decision-making.\r\n2.

By leveraging NLP, emergency responses and resilience activities can enhance decision-making, ensure more adaptive programming, and ultimately improve outcomes for vulnerable populations. \r\n\r\nDescription\r\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) offers transformative potential for enhancing program monitoring, evaluation, accountability, and learning (MEAL) in humanitarian contexts. By leveraging its ability to process and analyze large volumes of textual and spoken data, NLP can significantly improve decision-making and shock responsiveness, fostering program participant resilience and program activity adaptation.\r\n\r\n1.\tMonitoring\r\nNLP tools can process real-time feedback from various sources such as field reports, annual result reports, call logs, social media posts, and program participant surveys. For instance, text classification algorithms can identify recurring themes or emerging risks, such as supply shortages or security concerns. Named Entity Recognition (NER) can track locations, events, or organizations mentioned in reports, providing actionable insights into program performance.\r\n2.\tEvaluation\r\nNLP can analyze qualitative data, such as interviews, focus group transcripts, and open-ended survey responses. Sentiment analysis reveals trends in program participant satisfaction, while topic modeling identifies underlying themes or challenges. Multilingual machine translation tools allow organizations to evaluate programs across regions with diverse languages, ensuring inclusivity in feedback analysis.\r\n\r\n3.\tAccountability\r\nNLP-powered chatbots and automated systems can process complaints and feedback from affected populations. Categorization algorithms can prioritize urgent concerns, such as protection issues or overlooked program participant needs, for faster response. Sentiment analysis helps assess public trust and satisfaction, while text summarization ensures accountability reports are concise yet complete.\r\n4.\tLearning\r\nBy synthesizing information from past, and ongoing project activities, NLP can extract lessons learned and key success factors. Tools like document clustering and summarization can identify best practices across programs and sectors. Additionally, NLP can facilitate the creation of knowledge repositories, making insights easily accessible to staff and program stakeholders at various level for future planning.\r\n\r\nDespite its transformative potential, the application of NLP in humanitarian settings comes with challenges. These include ensuring data quality, addressing bias in algorithms, and adhering to ethical principles in data collection, especially in vulnerable communities. However, with considerate implementation, NLP can help humanitarian organizations make data-driven decisions, adapt to dynamic environments, and ultimately improve outcomes for crisis-affected populations.",

            "description": "In many fields, including research and industry, software is essential for driving innovation and scientific discovery, yet mechanisms for crediting software developers remain inconsistent and underdeveloped. This lack of recognition, particularly for open-source contributions, can discourage participation in software development and limit career opportunities for developers. Astronomy, as a computationally intensive discipline with a rich history of open-source software contributions, offers a valuable case study to examine these challenges. Over the past decade, changes in journal policies and emerging publishing practices have sought to address the issue, but their impact on credit attribution remains unclear.\r\n\r\nThis talk addresses the issue of software credit by analyzing publication and citation practices in astronomy. It evaluates how existing policies acknowledge software contributions and examines variations across journals and over time. Drawing on bibliometric data from the past decade, the analysis focuses on citation patterns for commonly used libraries, trends in citation rates, and the influence of journal policies. The study includes both foundational libraries, such as NumPy, and astronomy-specific libraries, such as Astropy. Based on these findings, the talk will offer recommendations to enhance the attribution of software contributions.\r\n\r\nThe issue of recognizing research software is not unique to astronomy or research. Participants from industry, other computationally driven fields, open-source communities, and publishing will find the insights applicable to their own disciplines. Understanding how software is cited and credited is critical for shaping more equitable recognition systems, which in turn support sustainable software development and community growth. The audience will leave with a clear understanding of how astronomy\u2019s experience can inform broader efforts to address similar challenges in their respective fields.\r\n\r\n The data and code for the analysis will be shared with participants giving participants access to a reproducible framework for analyzing software citation practices in other disciplines or software ecosystems.",

            "description": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has transformed how we build AI systems with Large Language Models (LLMs) by combining the strengths of retrieval and generation. However, traditional RAG workflows are static and often struggle to handle the dynamic and complex demands of real-world applications, such as answering multi-step queries, integrating external APIs, or gracefully recovering from retrieval failures. Agentic behavior addresses these challenges by extending RAG pipelines, enabling LLMs to make decisions, integrate tools, and dynamically adapt workflows.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we\u2019ll explore how agentic behavior enhances RAG pipelines. We\u2019ll define what it means for a system to act as an \u201cagent\u201d and cover core concepts like routing, tool calling, and reasoning. Using hands-on examples implemented in Python with Haystack, we\u2019ll walk through practical use cases, such as integrating external APIs and solving multi-step problems. Finally, we\u2019ll tackle challenges like transparency in complex systems and share how graph-based approaches can make these workflows more interpretable.\r\n\r\n### Outline:\r\n\r\n1.

            "notes": "It's a known fact that basic RAG cannot solve most real-world problems. Incorporating agentic behavior into the system is a quick solution to this problem. With this approach, we can take control of the LLM and give it to our application. This gives us builders more control, transparency, and customization ability over our application and gets our system one step closer to going into production.\r\n\r\nIn this session, I will explain the concepts around agentic behavior and show how to implement such a system using Haystack, the open source Python framework, to build custom LLM applications.\r\n\r\nWebsite: https://haystack.deepset.ai/\r\nGithub repo: https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack\r\n\r\nSome work similar to my topic:\r\n\r\n- https://medium.com/@pankaj_pandey/understanding-agentic-concepts-in-llm-workflows-fc8115504c06\r\n- https://haystack.deepset.ai/cookbook/web_enhanced_self_reflecting_agent\r\n- https://haystack.deepset.ai/cookbook/newsletter-agent\r\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeAyuLc_f3Q&ab_channel=AIEngineer\r\n\r\n**Objective:**\r\n\r\nShow how agentic behavior enhances RAG systems by enabling dynamic decision-making, tool integration, and adaptable workflows.

While some techniques are case-specific, most are broadly applicable for enhancing performance across various data-driven projects.",
            "description": "In the field of data science, performance is critical. While accuracy and insightful results are important, slow applications can significantly hinder the user experience. In many real-world scenarios, users expect not only correct but also fast results. Lagging or slow data science tools and applications often lead to frustration, decreased productivity, and a lack of trust in the tools. Whether it is in web apps, dashboards, or data pipelines, delays in processing can undermine the overall value of the analysis being provided. Thus, ensuring that data science applications run efficiently and swiftly is crucial for both user satisfaction and business success.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we explore a range of simple yet highly effective techniques to optimize performance, focusing on improving the speed of data processing and analysis. These techniques, while straightforward, can lead to significant improvements in the performance of data-driven applications. By adopting these methods, teams can optimize the user experience, reducing wait times and enabling quicker decision-making, all while maintaining the accuracy and integrity of the results.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important aspects of these techniques is their real-world applicability. To illustrate their effectiveness, we will share an example in which these methods were directly applied to a Panel app that required substantial performance improvement. Faced with the challenge of speeding up the app for its users, we were able to apply a variety of strategies that resulted in noticeable speed enhancements. These strategies ranged from optimizing underlying algorithms to leveraging parallel processing techniques, all aimed at reducing bottlenecks and streamlining data flow. The success of these methods not only improved performance but also demonstrated their value in a practical, real-world context.\r\n\r\nWhile some of the techniques discussed are tailored to specific use cases, most are broadly applicable and can be implemented across a wide range of data science projects. These approaches provide flexible and scalable solutions to performance challenges, making them useful for various applications \u2014 from dashboards to more complex data processing pipelines. By focusing on enhancing the speed of data handling and computation, our methods ensure that users can work more efficiently, thus allowing them to derive insights faster and respond to business needs in real-time.\r\n\r\nUltimately, improving the performance of data science applications is essential for both user satisfaction and the broader success of data-driven initiatives. Through the techniques we present, teams can significantly reduce latency, optimize processing times, and create smoother, faster user experiences, all without compromising the quality of the analysis. Whether you are working with a web app, an internal tool, or a production-level pipeline, the strategies shared in this talk can help you address performance issues effectively and improve the overall performance of your data science applications.",

            "description": "Join us for a humorous journey through the creation of Realejo, a cutting-edge art piece blending AI and animatronics to rekindle the magic of a classic Brazilian mechanical organ. Along the way, we discovered that the real challenge wasn\u2019t AI but reverse-engineering a pesky Bluetooth thermo printer. This talk celebrates Python, open source, and the unsung heroes of the web, showing how tech\u2019s quirks and obsolescence sometimes lead to the most unexpected lessons.\r\n\r\nIn this lighthearted 30-minute talk, we unravel the ironic journey behind Realejo, an ambitious art project blending AI, animatronics, and mechanical nostalgia. While we thought AI and animatronics would be our biggest challenges, the true adversary emerged from an unlikely place: a Bluetooth thermo printer. Its refusal to cooperate took us on a hilarious, maddening quest that revealed the often-overlooked beauty of human ingenuity and open-source collaboration.\r\n\r\nThe Art Piece: Realejo\r\nRealejo rekindles the charm of the classic Brazilian mechanical organ, a realejo, traditionally accompanied by a bird delivering oracular fortunes. Our modern rendition integrates AI to generate thoughtful, personalized messages, an animatronic bird to vocalize them via text-to-speech (TTS), and a printer to deliver these fortunes on paper. It\u2019s a celebration of care, intimacy, and creativity\u2014but one piece of this system did everything it could to sabotage the project.\r\n\r\nThe Villain: A Stubborn Bluetooth Thermo Printer\r\nThe AI? Easy. Animatronics? Manageable. The thermo printer? A nightmare.\r\nWe had assumed this little printer, designed to work seamlessly with phones and apps, would also cooperate with a computer. Spoiler: it didn\u2019t. Reverse-engineering its Bluetooth-only protocol to work with Python involved hours of debugging, failed experiments, and absurd technical hoops. This printer became a symbol of how technology sometimes traps us between sleek innovation and the painful reality of obsolescence.\r\n\r\nThe Hero: A Generous Reverse Engineer\r\nWhen all seemed lost, we stumbled upon an open-source repository\u2014a gift from a generous reverse engineer who had cracked the printer\u2019s code and shared their findings with the world. Armed with their work and Python\u2019s versatility, we finally tamed the thermo printer. Realejo could now print fortunes as intended, and we learned an invaluable lesson about the power of community-driven problem-solving.\r\n\r\nWhat We\u2019ll Talk About\r\n\r\nThis talk blends humor, reflection, and practical insights as we dive into:\r\n\t1.\tThe Creation of Realejo\r\n\t\u2022\tThe nostalgic charm of the realejo and its modern AI-powered reimagining.\r\n\t\u2022\tHow GPT and TTS were seamlessly integrated into an animatronic bird.\r\n\t\u2022\tThe vision of blending technology and intimacy to spark moments of kindness.\r\n\t2.\tThe Thermo Printer Saga\r\n\t\u2022\tWhy this seemingly simple device became the hardest part of the project.\r\n\t\u2022\tHow technological obsolescence creates unexpected barriers in creative work.\r\n\t3.\tThe Open Source Hero\r\n\t\u2022\tThe incredible individual who reverse-engineered the printer\u2019s protocol and shared their findings.\r\n\t\u2022\tHow Python and open-source communities empower artists, developers, and creators to push boundaries.\r\n\t4.\tReflections on Technology and Creativity\r\n\t\u2022\tHow tech often straddles the line between the futuristic and the outdated.\r\n\t\u2022\tWhy open-source collaboration is vital for fostering innovation and creativity.\r\n\r\nThis story is a testament to the unsung heroes of open source, whose generosity and curiosity empower creators to overcome seemingly impossible challenges. It also celebrates Python as the ultimate tool for bridging gaps, solving problems, and keeping art alive.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ll conclude with a demonstration of Realejo in action. Throughout the conference, the animatronic bird will be available for visitors to experience, offering AI-generated fortunes while showcasing the collaboration of art, technology, and community.\r\n\r\nThis talk will leave attendees with a renewed appreciation for the quirks of tech, the brilliance of open-source collaboration, and, of course, Python\u2019s indispensable role in making it all work.",

For many years there have also been alternative implementations with similar interfaces and libraries with completely new approaches that focus on achieving the ultimate in performance and hardware acceleration. This talk will look at the recent efforts to give users the best of both worlds: a familiar and widely used interface as well as high performance.",
            "description": "The interfaces defined by libraries like Numpy, pandas or scikit-learn are the defacto standard APIs in each library's domain. Data scientists use these libraries directly as well as indirectly through libraries that depend on them.\r\n\r\nThis talk will look at the different approaches that recent efforts have taken to give users both a familiar interface and GPU acceleration. This means users do not have to rewrite their code, learn a new library and benefit from acceleration when using existing libraries.\r\n\r\nThe cudf team built a pandas accelerator by diving deep into the import system of Python. By hooking into the import system you can replace the result of `import pandas as pd` with a library that uses cudf where possible and falls back to pandas where necessary. This is great as it means the user\u2019s seaborn code is automatically accelerated, without the user or the seaborn authors having to do anything.\r\n\r\nThe polars team collaborated with the cudf team to build a GPU engine for polars. They chose a tightly coupled approach where the cuDF library hooks in after the Polars Intermediate Representation is created from the user input. This means using the GPU engine is seamless from the point of view of the user, there is transparent fallback to the CPU and no import statements need changing.\r\n\r\nThe scikit-learn team is adding experimental support to handle PyTorch and CuPy inputs by using the array API standard. Instead of using the Numpy API to perform array computations, scikit-learn is switching to using the array API. This is a subset of the Numpy API that is supported by several other array libraries. The API of Numpy and PyTorch is similar but not exactly the same, this makes writing code that works with both hard. The array API addresses this problem by providing a unified API. Users can accelerate their scikit-learn code by passing in a CuPy or PyTorch array instead of a Numpy array.",

In my talk, I will introduce an elegant mathematical framework called Formal Concept Analysis (FCA), developed in the 1980s in Darmstadt.\r\n\r\nFCA transforms binary data into concepts that can be visualized as a hierarchical graph, offering a fresh perspective on multidimensional data analysis. Leveraging this theory and its open-source Python libraries, I am developing an interactive Dash-based tool featuring interactive tables and graphs to explore data insights.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate its potential, I will showcase an optimization of the entire tariffing system of an energy provider company, highlighting how FCA can bring structure and clarity to even such tangled datasets.",
            "description": "My goal is to introduce Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) as a fascinating mathematical framework. I aim to inspire Python enthusiasts to explore its potential and uncover insights in their data analysis tasks. The talk is divided into three sections:\r\n\r\n1 FCA Basics\r\n\r\n- What is a \"concept\"? *First, I am going to introduce the main terms used in FCA and define the central object of the theory - the formal concept.*\r\n\r\n- Illustrative example. *To show the power of FCA in action, I will provide a relatable example to explain the hierarchical structure of the graph visualization.*\r\n\r\n2 Python Implementation\r\n\r\n- ``fcapy`` Python library. *Core functionality overview of the library and the data formats it can use.*\r\n\r\n- Introducing interactivity with Python Dash: *Enhancing exploration and user experience with interactive tables (AG Grid) and dynamic graph visualizations (Cytoscape).*\r\n\r\n3 Applications and Practical Relevance \r\n\r\n- Use Case: Energy Tariffing System Optimization. *In this section, I am going to showcase the real data in its original complexity and the optimization process of identifying redundancies, overlaps, or inefficiencies.*\r\n- Examples of other  applications and key takeaways",

            "description": "Fast and reliable tests are the backbone of maintaining quality and performance in data-heavy applications, where even small issues can cascade into significant bottlenecks or failures. A streamlined testing process allows developers to confidently evolve complex systems while ensuring robustness and efficiency.\r\n\r\nFor integration and system tests in data-driven applications, the setup and teardown of data layers (e.g., databases, blob storage) often take more time than the actual test execution. A common approach is to use session-scoped test resources, but this introduces shared dependencies that couple tests together. As a result, developers must carefully manage resource cleanup after each test to prevent interference, leading to tests that are often flaky, verbose, and harder to maintain.\r\n\r\nThis talk will demonstrate how to leverage pytest fixtures to abstract setup and teardown logic across both session and function scopes. This method ensures proper resource cleanup, improves test isolation, and enhances test readability and development efficiency. We\u2019ll also explore strategies for parallelizing test execution while sharing system resources effectively, enabling faster and more scalable testing.\r\n\r\nThis talk is designed for intermediate to advanced Python developers with a strong interest in testing and improving their development workflows.",

Fairness and safety are not just ethical ideals\u2014they are critical pillars for the responsible development, deployment, and evaluation of AI systems. This is particularly important for applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), which are now shaping diverse fields like coaching, hiring, and financial services. However, ensuring these models meet rigorous fairness and safety standards presents complex challenges.\r\n\r\nIn this 30-minute talk, we will dive into five key areas:\r\n\r\n1. Introduction to LLM-Based Applications:\r\nWe\u2019ll begin with an accessible introduction to Large Language Models\u2014avoiding technical deep dives - and showcase real-world examples of how LLMs are applied across industries.\r\n\r\n2. Understanding Risks and Challenges:\r\nLLMs, while powerful, come with vulnerabilities such as biases and the potential for harmful behaviors. Discriminatory or toxic outputs can infringe on human rights, damage reputations, and result in financial loss. Through real-world examples, I will highlight these risks and discuss why addressing them is crucial.\r\n\r\n3. Defining Fairness and Safety in AI:\r\nWhat does it mean for an AI system to be fair and safe? Here, I will outline the key criteria for trustworthy AI applications, offering a framework to evaluate their ethical and societal impact.\r\n\r\n4. Evaluation Techniques and Tools:\r\nFrom public benchmarks to innovative prompt designs and metrics, we\u2019ll explore practical methods for assessing LLM trustworthiness. This section will empower participants to leverage the right tools to ensure their AI systems meet ethical and operational standards.\r\n\r\n5. Building the Future: Strategies for Fair and Safe AI:\r\nThe final segment focuses on actionable strategies to design and deploy fair, safe, and compliant AI systems. I\u2019ll also discuss the role of emerging regulations, such as the EU AI Act, in guiding responsible innovation.\r\n\r\nThis session offers valuable insights for researchers, developers, and decision-makers, equipping them to create AI systems that are not only high-performing but also aligned with societal values and evolving regulatory frameworks.",

            "abstract": "Traditional API architectures face significant challenges in environments where repetitive and frequent requests are required to retrieve data updates. These request-response mechanisms introduce latency, as clients must continually query the server to check for changes, often receiving redundant or outdated information. This approach leads to increased network overhead, inefficient use of server resources and diminished scalability as the number of clients or requests grows. Additionally, frequent requests expand the attack surface, requiring security measures to mitigate risks such as (un-)authorised access, rate limiting and query sanitisation. Managing all of these inherent problem results in increasingly complex systems to maintain and improve while putting considerable implementation effort onto the customer.\r\nJoin to find out how transitioning to a streaming architecture can address these issues by providing proactive, event-based data delivery, reducing latency, minimising redundant processing, enhancing scalability and simplifying security management.",
            "description": "In this talk we will go over which benefits, drawbacks and lessons Airbus has encountered/learned in the switch from an API to a Python based Stream Architecture for continuous flight traffic prediction. The Goal is to highlight Stream based architectures as a architectural alternative and allow the attendees to decide if it could be a alternative to their current API based Setup worthwhile to look into.\r\n\r\nThe talk addresses the inefficiencies and limitations of traditional API-based architectures for real-time data delivery. Specifically, it explores challenges such as high latency, network overhead, customer effort, and scalability issues when APIs rely on polling mechanisms. These issues became apparent at Airbus during a project as customer needs evolved, highlighting the shortcomings of APIs in handling real-time updates effectively. This story of the project will aid as an example on how to identify a limiting architectural decision and what pain points can potentially be avoided by taking a new route guiding us along the talk.\r\n\r\nFor developers and architects building modern, data-driven applications, choosing the right architecture is critical. Many face similar challenges when scaling APIs for real-time use cases, such as IoT, financial data, or notifications. This problem is relevant because adopting an unsuitable architecture can lead to poor performance, higher costs, and frustrated users.\r\n\r\nThe proposed solution is to transition from an API-based architecture to a streaming architecture for real-time data delivery. This involves leveraging stream processing systems that push updates proactively, handle high-throughput data efficiently, and offer features like backpressure, partitioning, and stateful processing. Recent developments in Python based tools such as **Bytewax**, **Faust** and **Quix** are highlighted for their scalability and fault-tolerance capabilities.\r\n\r\n### Key Takeaways\r\n1. **Challenges of APIs**: Polling APIs is inefficient for real-time updates, leading to delays, resource wastage, and customer dissatisfaction.\r\n2. **Advantages of Streaming**: Streaming architectures offer real-time data delivery, lower latency, reduced customer effort, better scalability, and improved fault tolerance.\r\n3. **Key Streaming Concepts**: Understanding backpressure, partitioning, and stateful processing is essential for understanding streaming specific limitations and solutions.\r\n4. **Architectural Considerations**: Streaming is ideal for use cases where data changes frequently and needs to be delivered in real time, while APIs may still be suitable for low-frequency, static, or manual queries.\r\n5. **Strategic Transition**: Adopting a streaming approach requires a paradigm shift in thinking about how data is delivered and processed, with significant changes to the system architecture which needs to be cautiously managed.",

            "abstract": "This talk will explore how Python can be leveraged to build robust DDoS defense mechanisms, focusing on real-time threat detection, mitigation strategies, and system resilience. We will dive into key Python libraries, best practices, and techniques to protect your applications from large-scale DDoS attacks while ensuring high availability.",
            "description": "In the world of modern web applications, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are a growing concern that can cripple services, disrupt business operations, and damage brand reputation. In this session, we\u2019ll dive deep into how Python, when combined with Jenkins, ELK Stack, and ElastAlert, can be used to create an effective, scalable, and resilient DDoS defense system.\r\n\r\nKey Takeaways:\r\n\r\n1. Using Python for Real-Time Detection:\r\n   - Learn how Python\u2019s versatility and performance make it an ideal tool for real-time detection of abnormal traffic patterns that are indicative of a DDoS attack.\r\n   - We will explore how Python scripts can monitor traffic, analyze request headers, identify rate-limiting violations, and trigger alerts when thresholds are exceeded.\r\n\r\n2. Automating Defense with Jenkins:\r\n   - Jenkins, a widely used automation server, can play a crucial role in the DDoS defense workflow by automating the response processes.\r\n   - We'll walk through how Jenkins pipelines can trigger specific defense mechanisms, such as blocking malicious IPs, scaling up server resources, or engaging additional security measures based on attack patterns identified by Python.\r\n\r\n3. Leveraging ELK Stack for Enhanced Monitoring and Visualization:\r\n   - Learn how to integrate Python scripts with the ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) Stack for better visibility into traffic patterns and security events.\r\n   - Elasticsearch will store and index traffic data, while Logstash processes and analyzes logs in real-time. Kibana\u2019s powerful visualization capabilities allow security teams to quickly identify anomalies and respond to potential DDoS threats.\r\n\r\n4. Proactive Alerts with ElastAlert:\r\n   - ElastAlert, a tool built on top of Elasticsearch, will be used to set up automated alerts and notifications whenever suspicious activity is detected by Python scripts.\r\n   - We\u2019ll discuss how to create custom alerting rules in ElastAlert to notify system administrators via email, Slack, or other communication channels when a DDoS attack is imminent or active.\r\n\r\n5. End-to-End Automation:\r\n   - Combining Python, Jenkins, ELK, and ElastAlert creates an integrated DDoS defense system where Python handles real-time detection and analysis, Jenkins automates defensive actions, ELK provides monitoring and visualization, and ElastAlert ensures timely alerts.\r\n   - This end-to-end solution improves the response time, reduces human error, and ensures that your system remains protected even under sustained attack.\r\n\r\nReal-World Use Case:\r\n\r\n- A gaming platform like PokerBaazi, with millions of active users, could benefit from this setup to defend against DDoS attacks that often target high-traffic periods or gaming events. Using Python, the platform can detect abnormal spikes in traffic patterns and trigger Jenkins to scale resources automatically or block malicious traffic through firewalls, all while sending out alerts to administrators through ElastAlert.\r\n\r\nWhy Attend?\r\n\r\nThis session will equip you with the knowledge to build an automated, scalable, and proactive DDoS defense system using Python and powerful open-source tools. Whether you're a DevOps engineer, a security analyst, or a developer, you\u2019ll walk away with actionable insights to protect your applications from the growing threat of DDoS attacks.",

By quantifying and understanding uncertainty, we can build more reliable and trustworthy systems.\r\n\r\nImagine we have a model that predicts whether or not a CT scan contains a tumour: traditional approaches tend to provide binary predictions, while not providing information on the model\u2019s confidence in each prediction.\r\n\r\nConformal Prediction (CP) is a framework for uncertainty quantification that offers an estimate of the confidence in the model\u2019s predictions: instead of providing just a point estimate, it provides a set of possible outcomes (prediction set), together with a measure of confidence in each outcome. These prediction sets come with a (mathematical!) guarantee of coverage of the true outcome, ensuring that they will detect at least a pre-fixed percentage of true values. CP is a model-agnostic paradigm, requiring no retraining of the model and making no major assumptions about the distribution of the data.\r\n\r\nWe Humans, when faced with uncertainty, tend to express indecision and offer alternatives. We will see that CP can be a key tool to include a human in the decision-making loop, once the \u2018humanised\u2019 machine is able to express its uncertainty.\r\n\r\nCP therefore offers a robust framework that allows stakeholders to make more informed decisions, even more so in high-risk sectors such as healthcare, finance and autonomous systems.",

            "description": "In the ever-evolving landscape of software development, Python stands out for its simplicity and versatility. However, its popularity brings the challenge of code duplication, known as code clones. This tutorial addresses the urgent need for a specialized dataset designed for Python code clone detection, essential for maintaining code quality and software maintainability.\r\n\r\nWe begin with a detailed methodology for extracting Python files from popular platforms like GitHub and GitLab. We focus on actively maintained repositories with recent activity, high star ratings, and significant fork counts to ensure a diverse and current dataset. This dataset reflects various domains, including data science, web development, and system administration.\r\n\r\nNext, we use cyclomatic complexity to assess the structural intricacies of the scripts, providing crucial insights for clone detection. We also evaluate the granularity level of each script to determine the appropriate detection level, whether at the function, statement, or other relevant levels.\r\n\r\nTo further enrich the dataset, we employ large language models (LLMs) to generate type-1, type-2, type-3, and type-4 code clones. These synthetic clones are meticulously validated to mirror real-world coding practices, capturing both semantic and syntactic variations. Each Python script is accompanied by metadata detailing its category, complexity level, granularity level, and clone type, providing valuable context for training and evaluating clone detection tools.\r\n\r\nThe primary objective of this tutorial is to demonstrate effective techniques for enhancing code clone detection tools. By providing developers and researchers with a curated dataset that showcases a variety of coding styles and complexities, we aim to improve their ability to identify and address Python code duplication. This tutorial is designed to advance software engineering practices through practical, hands-on learning.\r\n\r\nIn summary, we introduce an innovative approach to building a robust dataset for Python code clone detection, highlighting the importance of diversity, complexity measurement, and leveraging LLMs. By filling the gaps in existing datasets and methodologies, this tutorial aspires to push the boundaries of code clone detection and elevate the standards of software development.",

Here is the better alternative: Instructor, a library for generating structured and robust outputs from your LLM.\r\n\r\nIn this workshop, you will explore the capabilities and advantages of the Instructor library based on a real-world example using the OpenAI API. This workshop aims to provide you with an overview of Instructor's useful tools to receive reliable, structured, robust, and easily testable LLM outputs. Through hands-on exercises, you will learn three tools of Instructor:\r\n\r\n1. Function calling: Learn how OpenAI's function calling is simplified with instructor and how it helps creating a robust, structured LLM output. \r\n\r\n2. Validators: Learn to use validators for evaluating the output of an LLM and the advantage of automatically reprompting your model to provide the correct output.\r\n\r\n3. Hooks: Explore Instructor's pre- and post-execution-hooks to evaluate the LLM's output.\r\n\r\nAfter this workshop, you will have an overview of the possibilities provided by Instructor to generate structured, robust, and easily testable outputs from your LLM.",
            "description": "Many LLM use cases in the \"real world\" require structured outputs like JSON, for example, extracting information from multiple sources. This is especially important for continuously testing and evaluating your LLM's output, before and during production. Unfortunately, the default output of LLMs is typically unstructured.\r\n\r\nTo receive structured responses, the library 'Instructor' offers tools to ensure structured outputs from your LLM and to evaluate them. In this workshop, you will learn about the Instructor library based on Pydantic and the OpenAI API for obtaining structured LLM outputs that are easily testable and improve the debugging handling of your LLM application. You will explore the advantages and capabilities of Instructor in a real scenario: using an OpenAI GPT model to extract and summarize data from a ticket system. Based on this use case, you will learn three main tools of Instructor through hands-on exercises:\r\n\r\n1. Function calling: OpenAI's function calling allows LLMs to use user-defined functions to solve a task and thereby create a specific, structured output. In Instructor, OpenAI's function calling is combined with Pydantic. Instructor makes it easy to use function calling. Explore instructors features to simplify function calling, and the related advantages in creating robust, structured LLM outputs. \r\n\r\n2. Validators: Validators are provided by Instructor to evaluate the output of an LLM and reprompt it if the evaluation fails. You will learn how to create validators and examine specific use cases related to the ticket system. Furthermore, you will explore different types of validators and how they support you in creating a testable LLM system.\r\n\r\n3. Hooks: Instructor provides pre- and post-execution hooks that are triggered at specific events. You will dive into the concept of pre- and post-execution hooks and explore their capabilities for evaluating the LLM's output. You will see how to implement these hooks for transparency of the LLM's output, ensuring easy logging and debugging.\r\n\r\nAfter this workshop, you will have an overview of Instructor's tools, how they can help you let your LLM generate structured outputs, and how you can use Instructor for testing and evaluating your LLM's output.",

This talk introduces a novel quality assurance framework built with DSPy that addresses the unique challenges of evaluating AI agents in publishing workflows. Using real-world examples from newsroom implementations, I will demonstrate how to design and implement systematic testing pipelines that verify factual accuracy, content consistency, and compliance with editorial standards. Attendees will learn practical techniques for building reliable agent evaluation systems that go beyond simple metrics to ensure AI-generated content meets professional publishing standards.",
            "description": "This presentation addresses one of the most pressing challenges in professional publishing today: ensuring quality and reliability when deploying AI agents in editorial environments. We'll take a deep dive into how DSPy's programmatic approach to language model development can be leveraged to create robust testing and validation pipelines that meet the demanding standards of modern newsrooms.\r\nThe discussion begins by exploring the current landscape of AI evaluation in publishing workflows, examining why traditional testing approaches fall short when dealing with language models, and identifying the specific quality requirements unique to journalistic and editorial content. We'll then move into a detailed technical exploration of solutions built with DSPy, demonstrating how to design modular evaluation pipelines, implement publishing-specific metrics, and create automated systems for fact-checking and consistency validation. Special attention will be given to the integration of knowledge graphs for reference-based evaluation and the incorporation of these systems into broader MLOps workflows.\r\nTo ground these concepts in reality, we'll examine a detailed case study of implementing this framework in an actual newsroom environment. This will include practical discussions of handling various content types, along with strategies for managing test data and evaluation criteria. We'll share real-world performance monitoring approaches and concrete improvement strategies that have proven successful in production environments.\r\nThe presentation concludes with hard-won insights and best practices, including practical strategies for finding the right balance between automated testing and human review, effective approaches to handling edge cases, and methods for scaling quality assurance processes across diverse content teams. Throughout the talk, we'll share code examples and practical implementations that attendees can adapt for their own projects.\r\nThis session is specifically designed for technical leads and machine learning engineers, though the principles and approaches discussed will be valuable for anyone involved in AI quality assurance. Attendees will leave with a comprehensive understanding of how to design and implement QA processes for AI agents, practical knowledge of DSPy implementation for automated testing, and concrete strategies for maintaining high quality standards in AI-assisted workflows.",

It opens new possibilities for web-based scientific applications with an incredibly seamless and efficient user experience.\r\n\r\nEmscripten-forge is built around Emscripten to cross-compile C/C++ code to WebAssembly. This allows developers to package a wide range of scientific computing tools for the Web. Similar to classic package managers, emscripten-forge provides in-browser compute environments composed of these readily usable scientific computing packages. At the moment, it supports Python, R, and C/C++ packages, as well as a C++ interpreter powered by LLVM. Access to these environments is facilitated by JupyterLite, which serves as a user interface to an interactive, user-friendly and highly configurable platform for scientific computing running entirely in the browser.\r\n\r\nWith Emscripten-forge, in-browser scientific computing becomes available for everyone, in other words, sharing of complex computations and even large applications can be done with a simple link. This drastically simplifies existing workflows and opens up a whole range of new possibilities for collaboration.",
