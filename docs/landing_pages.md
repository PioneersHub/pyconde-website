# Dynamic Landing Page

> **Important:** Do not directly edit `content/contents.lr`. This file is automatically generated from the active or inactive landing page content.

The website displays one of two landing pages depending on the conference status:

1. **Pre-Conference and During Conference:** Displays conference information, CTAs, ticket sales, and registration details.

2. **Post-Conference:** Shows event highlights and summary to generate interest for the next conference.

## Managing Landing Page Content

The content for each landing page is stored in:

- **Active landing page:** `content/landing-page-active/contents.lr`
- **Inactive landing page:** `content/landing-page-inactive/contents.lr`

To edit a landing page, modify the appropriate file directly.

After making changes, run one of these commands to activate the desired landing page:

- **Activate conference mode:** `make activate-conference`
- **Activate post-conference mode:** `make disable-conference`

## Adding Images for the Post-Conference Landing Page

1. Add images to the appropriate folders in `assets/static/landing-page/`
2. Run `make landing-page` to update the databag
