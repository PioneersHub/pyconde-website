# Adding a Subsite

Adding a subsite requires modifications to the following components:

1. **Models** (`models/`): Define the data structure and fields for your subsite
2. **Databags** (`databags/`): Store configuration and content data
3. **Content Structure** (`content/`): Create the directory structure for your subsite pages
4. **Templates** (`templates/`): Create templates to render your subsite

For a complete example, examine the sponsors subsite implementation across these directories.
