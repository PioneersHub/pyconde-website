# Managing Talks in Pretalx

Do not add or modify talks directly in this repository. All changes will be overwritten.

All talk management (adding, changing, or removing) should be done in Pretalx. The website is updated automatically from Pretalx via a GitHub Actions workflow. See `.github/workflows/fetch_submissions.yml` for implementation details.
