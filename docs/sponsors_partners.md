# Adding Sponsors and Partners

To add a new sponsor or community partner, you need to do two things:

1. Copy the svg logo to `./assets/static/media/sponsors/`
2. Add the information for the sponsor to `./databags/sponsors.json`
3. Run `make sponsor-pages`. This will generate the individual sponsor page, based on the data in the databag.
