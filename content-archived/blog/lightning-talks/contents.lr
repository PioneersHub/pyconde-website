Lightning Talks ("LTs") at PyCon DE & PyData are short, 5-minute presentations open to all attendees. They’re a fun and fast-paced way to
share
ideas, showcase projects, spark discussions, or raise awareness about topics you care about — whether technical, community-related, or just
inspiring.

No slides are required, and talks can be spontaneous or prepared. It’s a great chance to speak up and connect with the community!

Lightning Talks will be live-streamed to share our knowledge and joy with the world.

### ⚡ Lightning Talk Rules

* No promotion for products or companies.
* No call for 'we are hiring' (but you may name your employer).
* One LT per person per conference policy.

#### Community Event Announcements

* ⏱ You want to announce a community event? You have ONE minute.
* All event announcements will be collected in a single slide slide deck, see instructions at the Lightning Talk desk in the Community Space
  in
  the Lounge on Level 1.

#### All other LTs:

* ⏱ You have exactly 5 minutes. The clock starts when you start — and ends when time’s up. That’s the thrill of Lightning Talks ⚡
* 🎯 Be sharp, clear, and fun. Introduce your idea, make your point, give the audience something to remember. No pressure. (Okay, maybe a
  little.)
* 🎲 You must include at least **one entry from the [official Bingo Card list](/bingocard/)**. Every audience member will receive a Bingo
  card — and they’ll be
  watching 👀 Your job? Choose at least one Bingo item from the [official Bingo Card list—](/bingocard/)and drop it into your talk. Subtly or
  dramatically — your style.
* 🐍 Keep it relevant to Python, PyData and the community. You can go broad — tools, workflows, stories, experiments — as long as there’s
  some connection to Python, PyData or the community.
* 👏 Keep it respectful. Keep it awesome. Humor is welcome, but please be kind, inclusive, and professional.
* 🎤 Be ready when your name is called. We’re running a tight session — speakers go on stage rapid-fire. Stay close and stay hyped.
* 🏆 Bonus prizes may be awarded. Best talk, best Bingo moment, most unexpected Hogwarts reference... who knows what could happen?

#### How to Submit

The Lightning Talk desk is located in the Community Space in the Lounge on Level 1.
