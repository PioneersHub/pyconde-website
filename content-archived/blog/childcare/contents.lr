If you need childcare during the event, we've got you covered!

Our childcare service for kids 6 months and older, will be available at the following times:

* Wednesday, 23.04. from 9:00 am to 17:00
* Thursday, 24.04. from 9:00 am to 17:00
* Friday, 25.04. from 9:00 am to 17:00

You can drop off and pick up your kids at any time during these hours, and we'll make sure they're entertained with
plenty of toys and crafts. 

The childcare area will be located inside the venue.

To ensure that we have enough childcare staff and resources to accommodate everyone, we kindly ask that you register for
childcare beforehand. Please get a ticket for each child each day you want to use the service.

[Register here](https://2025.pycon.de/buy-ticket/). 

To prevent bots from taking the tickets, a credit card is required for the reservation.

Please reserve your spot by **11 April at the latest**. 
 
Thank you for your cooperation and understanding! üôè
