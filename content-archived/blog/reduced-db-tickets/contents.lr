Make your journey to our upcoming conference in Darmstadt both affordable and environmentally conscious. 

We've partnered once again with Deutsche Bahn to offer you the Veranstaltungsticket – a specially priced train ticket that allows for comfortable and convenient travel to Darmstadt at a discounted fixed price.

This year, we're bringing the Python community together in the heart of Germany, and we want to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to participate. Think of it: a relaxing train journey, networking opportunities en route, and knowing you're contributing to a greener planet – all while saving money!
