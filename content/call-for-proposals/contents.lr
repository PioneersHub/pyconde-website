> We’ve received many awesome proposals! Since the pre-Christmas period was especially busy, we decided to extend the deadline for anyone who didn’t get a chance to submit.---


Our 2026 conference will take place in Darmstadt (close to Frankfurt), as a joint effort between PyCon DE and PyData offering dedicated tracks for diverse interests, with both on-site and remote access for attendees. Please note, while attendees can choose their mode of participation, presenters **must** deliver their sessions on-site.

Please go to our [Pretalx website](https://pretalx.com/pyconde-pydata-2026/cfp) to submit your proposals. You will need to set up an account there (it can be deleted by you anytime), and you can edit your proposals until the Call for Proposals closes.

Please feel free to forward this call to anyone you think might be interested in submitting a proposal.

**PyConDE** brings together developers, DevOps, scientists, and individuals from the Python community to discuss application techniques, updates to the language, further Open Source development, and the community. Our talks often include new features of the Python language, new libraries, security, testing, web, and programming & software engineering in general.

**PyData** brings together analysts, scientists, developers, engineers, researchers, enthusiasts and individuals from the AI & Data Science community to discuss applications of new tools and techniques. Our talks often include data management, analytics, visualisation as well as new machine learning, statistical, and deep learning approaches.

#### **Conference Tracks & Topics of Interest**

The conference will feature three main tracks.

- PyData
- PyCon
- General

Tutorials can be given in each of the tracks above. In order to simplify the review process and the creation of the program, you must select a track:topic for your talk from the list below:

- PyCon: MLOps & DevOps
- PyCon: Programming, Software Engineering & Testing
- PyCon: Python Language & Ecosystem
- PyCon: Security
- PyCon: Django & Web
- PyCon: Embedded Systems & Robotics
- PyData: Data Handling & Data Engineering
- PyData: Machine Learning & Deep Learning & Statistics
- PyData: Natural Language Processing & Audio (incl. Generative AI NLP)
- PyData: Computer Vision (incl. Generative AI CV)
- PyData: Generative AI & Synthetic Data
- PyData: PyData & Scientific Libraries Stack
- PyData: Visualisation & Notebooks
- General: Autonomous Systems & AI Agents
- General: Community & Diversity
- General: Education, Career & Life
- General: Ethics & Privacy
- General: Infrastructure - Hardware & Cloud
- General: Rust
- General: Others

We also welcome presentations focusing on a variety of topics all around Python and Data (incl. languages such as SQL, R and Rust). To see the presentation of previous events, please look at our past conference videos on YouTube at [PyData](https://www.youtube.com/@PyDataTV), [PyConDE](https://www.youtube.com/@PyConDE).

#### **Presentation Format**

Presentation content can be at a novice, intermediate or advanced level. Talks will have two possible lengths, either **30 or 45 minutes**, and hands-on tutorials will last **90 minutes**. While attendees can participate remotely, we require all speakers to deliver their presentations in person at the conference venue. We encourage submissions aimed at a highly python-proficient target audience, following the insights from last year's attendee self-evaluation:

- Beginner 20%
- Intermediate 45%
- Advanced 35%

Accepted submissions will receive one free ticket. Travel expenses will not be covered; however, we offer a support program aid and strongly encourage speakers, who may face financial barriers, to apply for travel funding when submitting your proposal.

#### **Submission Process**

After the submission deadline, proposals will be peer-reviewed and later selected by the program committee.

#### **Your Submission**

In our experience, attendees pay close attention to proposal abstracts when deciding which talks to attend during the conference. The submitted abstract will be published as is in the conference program (you can edit the submission later).

We are committed to offering our attendees a program filled with fresh and engaging perspectives. To achieve this, we seek submissions that bring innovative ideas, practical insights, and unique experiences to our audience. We kindly ask potential presenters to refrain from submitting material that has already been shared at other conferences or events, ensuring that our conference remains a platform for new and valuable content. Submissions that do not adhere to this guideline will be automatically rejected.

In your submission, please include details about the theory, concepts and/or practice you will discuss. Specifically, if the system you've built uses open source tools, please mention the libraries in the proposal and make it clear whether you will be presenting a case-study of their use or if you will discuss details of their design.

In general, conference attendees, as well as the program committee and reviewers, should be able to answer these questions based on your submission:

- What problem is your talk addressing (are you talking about a well-known problem, or have you found something new during a project)?
- Why is the problem relevant to the audience?
- What is (are) your solution(s) to the problem?
- What are the main takeaways from your talk? For a tutorial submission, this is extremely important, please specify what people will have learned at the end of the tutorial session.

We recommend including an outline of your talk to help the audience assess the content and structure of your submission.

As a reminder, PyConDE and PyData presentations are intended to share knowledge and experience. To this end, we encourage the code and/or data that your talk relies on to be open-source. Ideally, the audience would have access to the necessary tools to reproduce the results of the talk. Also, we welcome talks focused on your own practical application of tools and concepts either at work or in your free time, but discourage sales-oriented proposals whose sole aim is to sell a product.

### **Submit Your Proposal**

Go to our [Pretalx website](https://pretalx.com/pyconde-pydata-2026/cfp) to submit your proposal.

#### **Important Dates**

- **Talk Proposal Deadline:** ~~21 December 2025~~11 January 2026 23:59:59 CET
- **Acceptance Notification:** 11 February 2026
- **Conference Dates:** 14 - 16 April 2026

#### **Childcare**

During conference hours, there will be childcare offered for free.

#### **First-Time Speakers**

We especially encourage first-time speakers and submissions by underrepresented members of the community.

#### **Travel Sponsorship**

As a volunteer-run, non-profit conference, we are unfortunately unable to provide automatic travel sponsorship for speakers. Being accepted as a speaker does not make you eligible for travel support by default. Instead, we offer a [Financial Aid Programme](/financial-aid/) that is open to all community members. If you need financial assistance to attend the conference and present your talk, please apply to the programme immediately after submitting your proposal—do not wait for the acceptance notification.

#### **Code of Conduct**

We strive to maintain the Python community's reputation for being welcoming, friendly, and supportive. To this end, we ask all attendees, organisers and sponsors to follow the [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct).
