📅 Monday, 13 April 2026,  08:30-18:00
📍 hessian.ai, Landwehrstrasse 50a, 64293 Darmstadt

Join us for a full day of open-source hacking, learning, and collaboration! The sprints take place
Monday, April 13th, 2026 — the day before PyCon DE & PyData 2026 kicks off.
The sprints team provides lunch and Coffee/Mate/Diet-Coke— you bring the energy, ideas, and
code. Whether you're maintaining a major library or making your first contribution, there's
something for everyone.

## 💡 What Are Sprints?

Sprints are informal coding sessions (think: mini hackathons) where people gather to work on
open-source projects, share ideas, and solve problems together. For maintainers, it's a chance to
onboard new contributors and tackle long-standing issues. For participants, it's a low-barrier way
to dive into real projects and see your work make an impact right away.

 * Make your first open-source contribution
 * Get help from project maintainers directly
 * Push forward features, fix bugs, or improve documentation
 * Meet other contributors and collaborators in-person

​
➡️ <a href="https://forms.gle/zYUzvUyPE8E4ze2Y7" target="_blank"> Submit Your Sprint Project</a>

**Submission deadline:** 6th, April, 2026

**Accepted projects will be announced on a rolling basis** — no need to wait until the deadline to find out! Submit early, and we'll review and publish your project as soon as possible.

#### What Makes a Good Sprint Project?

Not sure if your project is a good fit? Here's what works well:

- **Has open issues** labeled for newcomers (e.g., `good first issue`, `help wanted`)
- **Clear onboarding** — A README and CONTRIBUTING.md help participants get started quickly
- **A sprint lead present** — You (or a co-maintainer) should be there to guide contributors
- **Welcoming to all skill levels** — Even if your project is advanced, having a few beginner tasks helps

#### What Will You Be Asked?

When submitting, we'll ask for:
- Project name & repository link
- Brief description
- What contributors will work on during the sprint
- Skill level(s) welcome (beginner / intermediate / advanced)
- Prerequisites (if any)
- Your contact info

⚠️ Depending on the number of submissions, the organizing team may limit projects based on capacity. Accepted projects will be listed below.

## FAQ

#### Do I need to choose a project when I register?

*No! You don't need to decide beforehand. During the **Opening Session**, all projects will introduce themselves, and you can choose which one to join based on your interests and skill level.*

*You're also free to **switch projects during the day**—maybe you want to try something new after lunch, or help out where there's extra need. Flexibility is part of the fun!*

#### Do I need a sprint ticket if I already have a PyConDE ticket?
*Yes, the sprints require a separate registration. Your PyConDE conference ticket does not include sprint access. Sprint tickets are €5 and capacity is limited.*

#### I'm new to open source—is this for me?
*Absolutely! Many projects welcome first-time contributors. Look for projects marked "Beginner-friendly" in the project list. Sprint leads are there to help you get started.*

#### What should I bring?
- *Your laptop (fully charged)*
- *Charger*
- *Your development environment ready (check project READMEs beforehand)*
- *Curiosity and good vibes!*

#### Do I need to stay the whole day?
*No, but we encourage you to join the Opening Session (09:00) to find a project, and the Closing Session (17:30) to celebrate everyone's contributions.*
