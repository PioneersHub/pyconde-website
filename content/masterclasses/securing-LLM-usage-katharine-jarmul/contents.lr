body:

In this masterclass, you'll learn ways to better protect your data when working with LLMs. We'll cover how to architect your systems for
better privacy and security, some introductions to red teaming and some basic protections for your text-based inputs (including guardrail
models and prompt sanitization). At the end of the course, you'll leave with some practical guides on how to use LLMs more safely with
private and sensitive data.
