## pytest Tips and Tricks for a Better Test Suite — Full-Day Masterclass

pytest lets you write simple tests fast—but also scales to very complex scenarios. This comprehensive full-day masterclass goes far beyond
the basics of no-boilerplate test functions, diving deep into intermediate and advanced features, hidden gems, and practical tricks that
will transform how you write and maintain your test suites.

### Who Should Attend

This masterclass is designed for developers who are already familiar with pytest basics (e.g., writing test functions, using `parametrize`,
understanding what a fixture is) and want to take the next step toward more powerful, maintainable test suites.

Even if you're already comfortable with fixture caching scopes, `autouse`, or built-in fixtures like `tmp_path` and `monkeypatch`, you'll
discover plenty of lesser-known tricks and gems throughout the day.

### What You'll Learn

* **Stricter, Safer Defaults** — Recommended pytest settings for catching issues early
* **Strategic Test Marking** — Understanding `xfail`, marking entire files, and marking individual parameters
* **Parametrization Mastery** — Cleaner IDs, syntax patterns, and advanced techniques
* **Fixtures In-Depth** — Caching strategies, implicit usage with `autouse`, and advanced patterns
* **Dynamic Customization** — Adapting fixture behavior based on markers or custom CLI arguments
* **Mocking & Patching** — Effective approaches and when to consider alternatives
* **The Plugin Ecosystem** — Useful plugins and how to write your own
* **Property-Based Testing** — Introduction to Hypothesis for finding edge cases automatically

The masterclass format allows time for hands-on exercises, real-world examples, Q\&A, and exploring the nuances that make the difference
between tests that merely pass and test suites that truly serve your project.
