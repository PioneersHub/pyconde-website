Teams are getting leaner, context switching is constant, and expectations remain high even when clarity is low. Many technical leaders find themselves reacting instead of leading: stepping in too often, firefighting instead of thinking strategically, and carrying pressure they can’t easily pass on.

This masterclass is for people who want to lead well under pressure without becoming the bottleneck, over-functioning, or burning out.

#### **Designed for**

* Engineering managers and tech leads  
* Senior individual contributors with leadership responsibility  
* Team leads working in lean, fast-moving environments  
* Leaders who care deeply about their teams and want to stay effective over time

### **What we will explore**

**Leading yourself under pressure:** How urgency and ambiguity shape your default responses as a leader. Learning to slow down enough to create space for thinking. Noticing when asking questions helps more than stepping in with answers.

**Supporting your team without taking over:** Building trust and transparency when clarity is low. Creating conditions for shared ownership and decision-making. Aligning around direction without having to solve every problem yourself.

**Staying strategic in a pressured organization:** Understanding where influence actually flows. Connecting team reality to organizational expectations. Maintaining perspective while supporting delivery in complex systems.

### **What you’ll take away**

Clearer insight into how pressure shapes your leadership. Practical experience using coaching to increase team agency. A better sense of where to focus your effort next: on yourself, your team, or the organization.

**Format:** Half-day interactive workshop. The session combines hands-on exercises, reflection, and peer learning, using the group as a space to think together about real leadership challenges.
