full_description:

In this talk, we'll dive into the Economic Complexity Index (ECI) and Product Complexity Index (PCI), revealing how these metrics, rooted in Complexity Theory, offer a fresh perspective on economic development. Learn how to compute and interpret these indices to guide innovation, compare countries and markets, and make informed, data-driven decisions.
We will apply the ECI to the domain of labour market data using job postings data to try to predict the emerging technologies, emerging skills in the different sectors and occupations.
