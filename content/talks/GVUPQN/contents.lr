full_description:

Data loading processes are complex and require effort to organize, often different tools are used and seamless processing is not ensured. Learn how to create pipelines efficiently and easily with Python in Snowflake Notebooks. Create and monitor tasks to continuously load data. Use third-party data directly to extend the data model without copying it. Harness the power of Python  to quickly calculate values and write efficient stored procedures.

In this session you will see how to
 - Load Parquet data to Snowflake using schema inference
 - Setup access to Snowflake Marketplace data
 - Create a Python UDF to convert temperature
 - Create a data engineering pipeline with Python stored procedures to incrementally process data
 - Orchestrate the pipelines with tasks
 - Monitor the pipelines with Snowsight
