abstract: In general elections, voters often face the challenge of navigating complex political landscapes and extensive party manifestos. To address this, we developed Electify, an interactive application that utilizes Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide concise summaries of political party positions based on individual user queries. During its first roll-out for the European Election 2024, Electify attracted more than 6,000 active users. This talk will explore its development and deployment. It will focus on its technical architecture, the integration of data from party manifestos and parliamentary speeches, and the challenges of ensuring political neutrality and providing accurate replies. Additionally, we will discuss user feedback and ethical considerations, focusing on how generative AI can enhance voter information systems.
