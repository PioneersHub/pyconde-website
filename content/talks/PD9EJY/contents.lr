abstract: AI models are only as good as the data that trains them. In this talk, we will explore the top five pitfalls in web data collection and preparation that can hinder AI models' performance, fairness, and longevity. From addressing data bias and ensuring diverse datasets to balancing model complexity and maintaining data quality, attendees will clearly understand how to avoid common mistakes. Additionally, weâ€™ll cover the critical issue of data drift and how to future-proof AI models against evolving real-world conditions. Packed with actionable insights, this session is designed for data scientists, engineers, and AI practitioners looking to enhance the reliability and effectiveness of their models.

description: Building robust AI models starts with understanding and addressing common challenges in web data collection and preparation. This session focuses on the five most critical pitfalls to avoid:

Data Bias: Explore the risks of biased datasets and their potential to produce unfair or discriminatory AI outcomes. Learn strategies to detect and mitigate bias, ensuring fairness and inclusivity in your models.

Insufficient Data Variety: Understand the importance of diverse datasets for training AI models that can perform effectively across varied scenarios and real-world conditions.

Overfitting and Underfitting: Discover how to strike the right balance in model complexity, avoiding the traps of overfitting and underfitting to achieve optimal generalization.

Poor Data Quality: Recognize how errors, inconsistencies, and poor labeling in training data can undermine AI reliability, and learn best practices for ensuring data integrity.

Ignoring Data Drift: Learn how to monitor and adapt to data drift over time, keeping AI models relevant and effective in changing environments.
