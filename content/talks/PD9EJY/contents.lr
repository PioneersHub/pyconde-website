abstract: AI models are only as good as the data that trains them. In this talk, we will explore the top five pitfalls in web data collection and preparation that can hinder AI models' performance, fairness, and longevity. From addressing data bias and ensuring diverse datasets to balancing model complexity and maintaining data quality, attendees will clearly understand how to avoid common mistakes. Additionally, weâ€™ll cover the critical issue of data drift and how to future-proof AI models against evolving real-world conditions. Packed with actionable insights, this session is designed for data scientists, engineers, and AI practitioners looking to enhance the reliability and effectiveness of their models.
