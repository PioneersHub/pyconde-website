abstract: This tutorial shows how apply classical models and new time series models (based on LLMs) to 
nowcasting stock markets crisis events.
Specifically, we'll how the transmission mechanisms across stock markets can 
be used to train machine learning models to predict crisis events. The tutorial'll show 
the entire pipeline: from the preparation of the dataset,
how balance observations and how measure our performances.
