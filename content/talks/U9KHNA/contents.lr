abstract: Bayesian methods are not commonly seen in Civil Engineering and Structural Dynamics. In this talk we explore how RxInfer.jl and the Julia Programming Language can simplify Bayesian modeling by implementing a Kalman filter for tracking the dynamics of a structural system. Perfect for engineers, researchers, and data scientists eager to apply probabilistic modelling and Bayesian methods to real-world engineering challenges.
