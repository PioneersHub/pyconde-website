How on earth can you manage the lives of other people if you struggle managing your own? With this logic I convinced myself for so much of my career that management wasn’t for me. Here’s why I was wrong, and why tech needs more neurodivergent people leading teams.

full_description:

How on earth can you manage the lives of other people if you struggle managing your own? With that logic, I ruled myself out of management for years. Then I took a leap and became an engineering manager. And you know what? I realised I was good at it. And whilst my ADHD will always ensure I play life on hard-mode (and management is no different), I was surprised at the ways my past experiences, my quirks, my traumas and all the eccentricities bundled into my messy brain were in fact the reasons I succeeded as a manager. 

In this whirlwind tour of my three years so far as an EM, I’ll knit together a series of lessons I learnt (sometimes very difficult ones), I’ll sprinkle a dusting of practical advice you won’t find in neurotypical management books, and I’ll cover a few of the areas and weaknesses in which I still struggle and how I’m working on them.

Don’t worry, this won’t be one of those “ADHD can be your superpower” talks. But I hope my experiences as a neurodivergent Engineering Manager during one of the most turbulent periods in tech in recent history will at least banish the thoughts in your head that you could never do it. And that your own experiences, far from hindering you, will in fact likely give you the empathy and understanding you need to lead a fulfilled and effective team.
