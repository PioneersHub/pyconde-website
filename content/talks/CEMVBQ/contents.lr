abstract: Computer vision, the field focused on enabling machines to interpret and understand visual data, tackles challenges like image recognition, object detection, and scene understanding. PyData tools play a critical role in solving these issues by offering robust libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, and Langchain for building and training machine learning models, performing image processing, and managing large datasets. This hands-on session will enable attendees to learn how to optimize computer vision projects with end-to-end version control baked in.
