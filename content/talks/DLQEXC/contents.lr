abstract: Developing machine learning features on big data demands sophisticated parallelization strategies, fundamentally impacting how we approach both modeling and engineering. This talk explores the technical challenges that arise when feature engineering requires distributed computing frameworks, blurring traditional boundaries between ML modeling and engineering roles. Through a retail case study, we examine practical solutions in parallel data processing, including architectural decisions around class granularity and data structures. Drawing from project experiences, we discuss how parallelization requirements influence feature design, model development, and production deployment, demonstrating why success in big data ML projects requires deep collaboration between modeling and engineering teams.
