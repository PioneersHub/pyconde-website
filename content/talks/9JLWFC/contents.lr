abstract:

Proper software engineering? For data pipelines? 

This was needed: The energy system is changing rapidly. The share of renewable energies is increasing, more storage solutions and new loads (e-mobility, heat pumps) are being integrated and coal power plants will be phased out. Can flexibility and generation balance the load?The analysis of resource adequacy has become more complex. Data from various sources is collected and processed. Simulations of the electricity market are carried out for hundreds of possible weather and power plant outage scenarios. The results of the simulations are aggregated, visualized and analyzed together with the input data. Plenty of data processing needed!

And this is what we did: Set up our platform. And, well, stick to the rules. Write our tests, automate our deployment, deploy frequently, use infrastructure as code, get early feedback from the users.

Spoiler: Yes, it’s worth it! With this practical example, we present how we have created an easy to use platform that allows the specialist team to produce meaningful data analyses while data and software engineers implement stable pipelines.

Want to learn about the above buzzwords? Know them already and seek some reassurement? Want to see them applied to a Databricks based project? Then this talk is for you.

full_description:

The business problem: 
* We face the challenge of assessing the security of power supply through renewables, storage, and cross-border trade.
  * This is addressed by optimizing resources to minimize uncovered energy across 700 possible scenarios.
* The data for those energy system simulations needs to be prepared and the results analyzed.
The technical solution:
  * We will present a data platform on Azure and Databricks, designed for stability, low-threshold use, and collaborative development that supports the simulation process by providing reliable, up-to-date data.
How we got there:
  * We will demonstrate the implementation of software engineering best practices that helped us build a reliable and stable solution. This includes version control, automated testing, and CI/CD pipelines within the Python/Pyspark/Databricks ecosystem
  * We will discuss challenges, such as adapting tools for the enterprise environment and optimizing data processing performance.
  * Finally we will show how the solution helped in answering questions around generation adequacy and what further technical and practical improvements we plan to add. 


Participants will learn
how data is used to enable the energy transition,
how to provide specialist users with an easy-to-use platform for analysis,
how to successfully integrate software engineering practices such as testing and frequent, rapid releases,
how to build a lean data solution that can be operated cost-effectively with few employees.
A few tips on the challenges of software development in critical infrastructures.

Attendees will also leave the room knowing that it does not need the newest, fanciest frameworks, but rather a focus on business problems and the usage of proven practices that also apply to the data engineering discipline.
