abstract:

Python packaging is evolving rapidly, with new tools being introduced regularly. While many talks and articles focus on packaging, they often lack a clear and structured overview of the available tools.

This talk will provide a detailed comparison of various packaging and environment management tools and there evolution over time. I will evaluate them based on predefined features, helping developers understand their differences and choose the right tools for their needs.
