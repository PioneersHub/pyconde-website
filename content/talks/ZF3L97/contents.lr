abstract: Building core data infrastructure demands a combination of performance, scalability, and adaptability. While Python is still the lingua franca of data science and analytics, there are a lot of benefits Go brings to the table, particularly around performance, concurrency and ease of deployment.

In this talk, we'll go through our journey in building core data infrastructure using Go and Python, and dig into the interoperability between the two languages. We'll also discuss how we've leveraged Go's performance and concurrency features to build scalable and reliable open-source data tooling.

description: In this talk, we will dive into the technical journey of building a CLI application using Golang as the foundation. We'll start by exploring the motivations behind choosing Go for this task, focusing on its performance, concurrency capabilities, and ease of deployment. 

Next, we'll delve into the specific challenges we encountered during the development process, such as managing dependencies, handling concurrency, and ensuring cross-platform compatibility. We'll share insights on how we addressed these challenges and the lessons learned along the way.

The core of the discussion will center around the interoperability between Go and Python. We'll provide a detailed explanation of how we integrated Python libraries into the Golang CLI, including the use of cgo, embedding Python interpreters and other tools to bridge the gap between the two languages. We'll also discuss the pros and cons of various approaches, highlighting the performance trade-offs and the complexities involved in maintaining such a hybrid system.

We'll talk about the implications of such an approach on a real-world open-source project, and demonstrate how it leverages the strengths of both Go and Python to deliver a powerful and scalable solution for data infrastructure. We'll provide examples and use cases to illustrate its capabilities and invite the audience to contribute to its development.

Join us for a technical deep dive into the world of Go and Python interoperability, and learn how to harness the best of both languages to build robust and efficient data tools.
