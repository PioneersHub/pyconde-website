abstract:

In this workshop, we will build an AI system using an LLM agent to build the AI pipelines that make up the AI system. We start by defining the data source(s) for our AI system and build a feature pipeline using our LLM that will extract features (and labels) from the data sources. We then build a training pipeline from our features, outputing a trained model. Finally, we will build an inference pipeline and user interface (in Python) using our trained model and input features. The AI pipelines are connected by shared state in the form of a free serverless feature store & model registry (Hopsworks). You will learn how to use LLMs to improve AI pipeline developer velocity and accelerating the time to your first working version of your AI system.
