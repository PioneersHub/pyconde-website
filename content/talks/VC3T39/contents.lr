### Anna-Lena Popkes

I'm Anna-Lena, a machine learning engineer living in Bonn, Germany. I'm very passionate about learning and love to share my knowledge with other people. Besides machine learning I love teaching Python and have been a regular guest on PyCon events and podcasts.

### Daniel Hieber

Hi, I'm Daniel, a PhD student in digital neuropathology at Julius-Maximilians-University WÃ¼rzburg and a research associate at the University Hospital Augsburg as well as Neu-Ulm University of Applied Sciences. My work focuses on applying computer vision techniques to automate analysis processes in the pathological departments and provide physicians with the tools to conduct machine learning on their own.

### Dr. Marisa Mohr

I'm Marisa, I live in LÃ¼beck, Germany, I'm a mathematician and Team Lead at inovex. With a passion for data, demystification, and people, Iâ€™m on a mission to bridge the gap between complex mathematical concepts and real-world understanding. Whether itâ€™s through interpretability, explainability, or fostering equal opportunity and fairness, I believe that math can â€“ and should â€“ be accessible to everyone.

### Hannah Hepke

I'm Hannah, a data and machine learning engineer living in Karlsruhe, Germany. With a strong interest in Artificial Intelligence, I am excited to start my journey in this dynamic field. I am passionate about teaching and take great pleasure in breaking down complex concepts and making them accessible to others, fostering a collaborative learning environment.

abstract:

Welcome, mini-Pythonistas! In this workshop, weâ€™ll dive into the world of ZÃ¼mi, a programmable car thatâ€™s much more than just wheels and motors. With built-in sensors, lights, and a camera, ZÃ¼mi can learn to recognize colors, respond to gestures, and even identify faces â€” all with your help!

Note, this is a kids workshop: All children and young people up to the age of 16 are welcome.

## Summary
Welcome, mini-Pythonistas! In this workshop, weâ€™ll dive into the world of ZÃ¼mi, a programmable car thatâ€™s much more than just wheels and motors. With built-in sensors, lights, and a camera, ZÃ¼mi can learn to recognize colors, respond to gestures, and even identify faces â€” all with your help!

Note, this is a kids workshop: All children and young people up to the age of 16 are welcome.


## More Details
Whether youâ€™re brand new to programming or a seasoned Python pro, thereâ€™s something here for everyone:
* Blockly: Perfect for beginners! Learn the basics of programming by snapping together colorful blocks.
* Jupyter Notebooks: Already know about variables and loops? Take the next step and explore more advanced coding concepts.
* Python Scripting: For our experienced coders, write your own Python scripts and push ZÃ¼mi to its limits.

What can you teach ZÃ¼mi?
* Drive and park autonomously: With infrared sensors, ZÃ¼mi can detect obstacles, stop, and adjust its course.
* Recognize colors: Train a machine learning model to teach ZÃ¼mi to stop or react when it sees a specific color.
* Identify faces: Using its camera, ZÃ¼mi can spot faces in photos and even recognize a smile!
* and many more!

Join us for a fun-filled adventure where coding meets creativity and discovery. Letâ€™s see what you and ZÃ¼mi can achieve together! ðŸš—ðŸ’»âœ¨
