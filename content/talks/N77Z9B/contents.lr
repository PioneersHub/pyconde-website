abstract: In this talk, we will explore how to use Markov chains to model user journeys on websites. By handling event-based user data from websites and aggregating them into user journeys, we can utilize Markov chains to calculate the contribution of each touchpoint during a website visit, leading to a lead submission or newsletter sign-up. The findings can help to better understand the impact of (sub-)pages visited during the user journey to achieve the intended goal.
Our use case feeds back the results into advertising platforms to improve the performance of advertising campaigns. The audience will gain insights into the challenges faced during the transition from a Proof of Concept (POC) phase using custom Jupyter notebooks to a scalable web application solution that allows end-users to self-service their requests.
