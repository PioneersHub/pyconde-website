abstract: In this talk, we will explore how to use Markov chains to model user journeys on websites. By handling event-based user data from websites and aggregating them into user journeys, we can utilize Markov chains to calculate the contribution of each touchpoint during a website visit, leading to a lead submission or newsletter sign-up. The findings can help to better understand the impact of (sub-)pages visited during the user journey to achieve the intended goal.
Our use case feeds back the results into advertising platforms to improve the performance of advertising campaigns. The audience will gain insights into the challenges faced during the transition from a Proof of Concept (POC) phase using custom Jupyter notebooks to a scalable web application solution that allows end-users to self-service their requests.

description: This proposal aims to provide an understanding of Markov chains and their application. Our Case Study shows how to apply the developed approach to optimize online advertising and the practical steps involved in developing the simple POC into an application. The entire system is based on the python ecosystem.

1.	Introduction: Online Advertising and Real-Time Bidding
•	Overview of online advertising and the mechanics of real-time bidding (RTB).
•	Discussion on optimizing online advertising campaigns.
2.	Determine value of users for websites and advertising
•	Explanation of how value can be expressed beyond traditional e-commerce metrics.
•	Importance of leads and newsletter sign-ups for companies that do not sell products directly online.
3.	Data Processing and Modeling
•	Tracking user interactions and preprocessing event-based data from website traffic.
•	Introduction to Markov Chains.
•	Applying Markov chains to user behavior and modeling user journeys.
•	Calculating the contribution of each touchpoint with the effect of removal.
4.	Implementation Steps and Challenges
•	Detailed walkthrough of data preprocessing steps and common difficulties encountered.
•	Transition from custom notebooks to a web app-based solution for end-user self-service.

Our solution involves using open-source tools and libraries such as:
•	Pyspark / Pandas for data manipulation and preprocessing.
•	Numpy for solving the underlying algebra.
•	Streamlit for developing the web application.

Main Takeaways
By the end of the talk, attendees will have learned:
•	How to preprocess and model event-based data from website traffic.
•	The application of Markov chains to model user journeys and calculate the contribution of touchpoints.
•	The challenges in scaling from a POC phase to a scalable web app solution.
