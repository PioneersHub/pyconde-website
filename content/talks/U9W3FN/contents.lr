abstract: Zarr is a data format designed for storing large n-dimensional arrays either on-disk or in the cloud. With its 3.0 release, the zarr-python library has undergone a significant overhaul. Among the key advancements is support for the latest Zarr specification, which introduces the new sharding featureâ€”enabling efficient storage and access to n-dimensional arrays scaling to petabyte sizes. This release also brings a comprehensive refactor of the library, leveraging asynchronous operations to deliver substantial performance gains. Additionally, the library has been redesigned for greater extensibility and fully modernized with 100% type hint coverage.
In my talk, I will provide an introduction to the Zarr format and the zarr-python library, followed by a detailed overview of the major changes introduced in the 3.0 release.
