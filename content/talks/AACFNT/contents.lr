full_description:

In this talk, Armağan Amcalar addresses the transformative journey toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) through autonomous, collaborative multi-agent systems. Drawing from his extensive experience in developing and applying these systems, Armağan will explore how independent agents can work together, learn from each other, and adapt to complex environments to achieve common goals. Participants will gain insights into the latest developments, challenges faced, and future directions in this dynamic field, understanding how collaborative multi-agent systems pave the way for the next generation of intelligent machines. Join us to explore the potential and complexities of these systems in the pursuit of AGI.
