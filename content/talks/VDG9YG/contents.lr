abstract:

This talk explores the world of logits - the raw confidence scores that language models generate before selecting each token. Understanding and manipulating these scores gives you practical control over how models generate text.

In this introductory session, we'll explore the token-by-token generation process, examining how tokenizers work and why vocabulary matters. You'll learn about the relationship between logits, softmax functions, and probability values that drive text generation.

full_description:

Logits are the raw numerical scores that language models compute for each token in their vocabulary before making a selection. These scores are converted to probabilities and used internally for token selection. Accessing and analyzing them directly opens up possibilities for controlling and understanding model behavior.

We'll cover common sampling techniques like temperature adjustment, top-k, and top-p filtering, along with more advanced approaches like beam search. The talk introduces practical applications through custom samplers.

Logits also provide insights into model uncertainty, help detect potential hallucinations, and enable fine-grained control over generation. 

Throughout the session, we'll run live experiments demonstrating these concepts in action. We'll explore helpful libraries and tools. You can get practical insight which you can apply to your own projects. No advanced math or deep ML expertise required—just a curiosity about how language models make decisions.
