Join us for a humorous journey through the creation of Realejo, a cutting-edge art piece blending AI and animatronics to rekindle the magic of a classic Brazilian mechanical organ. Along the way, we discovered that the real challenge wasn’t AI but reverse-engineering a pesky Bluetooth thermo printer. This talk celebrates Python, open source, and the unsung heroes of the web, showing how tech’s quirks and obsolescence sometimes lead to the most unexpected lessons.

In this lighthearted 30-minute talk, we unravel the ironic journey behind Realejo, an ambitious art project blending AI, animatronics, and mechanical nostalgia. While we thought AI and animatronics would be our biggest challenges, the true adversary emerged from an unlikely place: a Bluetooth thermo printer. Its refusal to cooperate took us on a hilarious, maddening quest that revealed the often-overlooked beauty of human ingenuity and open-source collaboration.

The Art Piece: Realejo
Realejo rekindles the charm of the classic Brazilian mechanical organ, a realejo, traditionally accompanied by a bird delivering oracular fortunes. Our modern rendition integrates AI to generate thoughtful, personalized messages, an animatronic bird to vocalize them via text-to-speech (TTS), and a printer to deliver these fortunes on paper. It’s a celebration of care, intimacy, and creativity—but one piece of this system did everything it could to sabotage the project.

The Villain: A Stubborn Bluetooth Thermo Printer
The AI? Easy. Animatronics? Manageable. The thermo printer? A nightmare.
We had assumed this little printer, designed to work seamlessly with phones and apps, would also cooperate with a computer. Spoiler: it didn’t. Reverse-engineering its Bluetooth-only protocol to work with Python involved hours of debugging, failed experiments, and absurd technical hoops. This printer became a symbol of how technology sometimes traps us between sleek innovation and the painful reality of obsolescence.

The Hero: A Generous Reverse Engineer
When all seemed lost, we stumbled upon an open-source repository—a gift from a generous reverse engineer who had cracked the printer’s code and shared their findings with the world. Armed with their work and Python’s versatility, we finally tamed the thermo printer. Realejo could now print fortunes as intended, and we learned an invaluable lesson about the power of community-driven problem-solving.

What We’ll Talk About

This talk blends humor, reflection, and practical insights as we dive into:
	1.	The Creation of Realejo
	•	The nostalgic charm of the realejo and its modern AI-powered reimagining.
	•	How GPT and TTS were seamlessly integrated into an animatronic bird.
	•	The vision of blending technology and intimacy to spark moments of kindness.
	2.	The Thermo Printer Saga
	•	Why this seemingly simple device became the hardest part of the project.
	•	How technological obsolescence creates unexpected barriers in creative work.
	3.	The Open Source Hero
	•	The incredible individual who reverse-engineered the printer’s protocol and shared their findings.
	•	How Python and open-source communities empower artists, developers, and creators to push boundaries.
	4.	Reflections on Technology and Creativity
	•	How tech often straddles the line between the futuristic and the outdated.
	•	Why open-source collaboration is vital for fostering innovation and creativity.

This story is a testament to the unsung heroes of open source, whose generosity and curiosity empower creators to overcome seemingly impossible challenges. It also celebrates Python as the ultimate tool for bridging gaps, solving problems, and keeping art alive.

We’ll conclude with a demonstration of Realejo in action. Throughout the conference, the animatronic bird will be available for visitors to experience, offering AI-generated fortunes while showcasing the collaboration of art, technology, and community.

This talk will leave attendees with a renewed appreciation for the quirks of tech, the brilliance of open-source collaboration, and, of course, Python’s indispensable role in making it all work.
