abstract: Dive into the quirky journey of Realejo, a modern AI-powered reimagining of the Brazilian mechanical organ. While animatronics and AI were a breeze, the real villain was a stubborn Bluetooth thermo printer. This talk celebrates the human hero who saved us with open-source code, Pythonâ€™s adaptability, and the beauty of community-driven problem-solving in the face of technological obsolescence.
