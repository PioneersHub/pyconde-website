Wearer of many hats, but some of my favorite are Python enthusiast, social science researcher and amateur musician. Currently based in Berlin, Germany where I work as a senior software engineer and am an active participant in the conda open source community. I'm also an organizer of the Python Users Berlin group.

abstract:

When conducting studies of the urban form, an important resource many researchers turn to is the massive OpenStreetMap dataset. But, as extensive as this dataset is, it lacks one very important aspect about the cities it covers: the people who live there. In this talk, I show you how to add this missing element to your research by bringing in German Census data to create rich analysis capable of answering some of the most pressing issues facing our cities today. I exemplify this by walking you through my own research in urban geography and sustainability with a study of how equitably distributed common amenities are in cities across Germany. Throughout, we look at how Python and PostgreSQL can be used as effective tools to enable this research and keep it organized.

full_description:

By the end of this talk, audience members will be empowered with the tools they need to help identify and bring light to important problems affecting their cities. To achieve this, I show how to combine data on urban structure from OpenStreetMap and demographic data from the German Census in PostgreSQL. Once the data is gathered, I then show how to do the actual analysis and present the findings with Python.

The presentation will be broken up into the following sections:

**Laying the foundation**

The first step is creating an organized database that will serve as the data source for the rest of the study. I show how to use "PgOSM Flex" for this plus a tool that I wrote in Python to make it easy to import German Census data into PostgreSQL.

**Asking meaningful questions**

With all the data in place, it's time to formulate a research question to drive our analysis. Formulating a meaningful research question can keep our analysis on track and much better organized. To get there, we explore the data we have available and consider the types of questions we can actually answer.

**Analyze and present**

Now that we have a clear question in mind, we'll construct the queries we need to generate the data necessary for our analysis. Once exported from PostgreSQL, we perform the analysis and generate the final reports using popular scientific libraries in Python.

**Final thoughts**

To conclude the talk, I share how this analysis could be extended by including even more datasets. I also discuss the limitations of these types of studies while offering practical advice on how you can make a positive impact with your research.
