abstract: The talk gives a quick introduction to xenharmlib, a GPL-licenced generalized music theory library that supports non-Western harmony traditions and novel microtonal tunings. The library is meant as a tool belt for programmer-composers to find harmonizations, chord progressions, improvisation scales and more in unfamiliar terrain. As an illustration the talk will feature strange and other-wordly sounds.
