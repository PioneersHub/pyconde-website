abstract: The entire industry approves of unit testing but almost no one can fully agree on how to do it correctly, or even on what unit tests are. This results in unit tests often being associated with slower development cycle and an overall less enjoyable workflow. I'll show you how testing turns into hell in real enterprises with the most common anti-patterns and then I'll show you that most of them are avoidable with modern tooling like mutation testing, snapshot testing, dirty-equals, and many more. We'll discuss how to make tests speed up your development and make refactoring easy.
