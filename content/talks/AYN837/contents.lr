abstract: Raw large language models struggle with complex reasoning. New techniques have
emerged that allow these models to spend more time thinking before giving an answer.
Direct token sampling can be seen as system-1 thinking and explicit step-by-step
reasoning as system-2. How can this reasoning ability be improved and what is the future?
