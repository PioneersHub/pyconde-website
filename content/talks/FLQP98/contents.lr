abstract: This technical session will explore how Python can be used to scale Machine Learning (ML) workloads on Kubernetes. We'll explore the architecture behind ZEISS's computer vision platform, which supports training and inference for various ML model types. You will learn how a Python-based service orchestrates containerized workloads, leveraging Celery, RabbitMQ, and Redis to manage tasks and monitor status. Gain insights into handling challenges such as inter-service communication, secure data access, and Kubernetes role configurations, all while adhering to the principle of least privilege. This session is ideal for developers building scalable ML platforms on Kubernetes.
