abstract: Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems provide real-time measurements every 5-15 minutes via a small sensor placed under the skin. Interstitial glucose measured with CGM sensors is a reliable proxy for blood glucose, thus reducing the need for frequent fingerpricks. The rich datasets generated by CGM systems are invaluable for both clinical care and diabetes research. However, CGM exports – even though available in CSV or XLSX formats – are often inconsistent, non-machine-readable and lack metadata, making data preparation time-consuming and error-prone. 

To address these challenges, we developed GluCINDa (Glucose: Coherent Import. Neat Data.), a Python-based tool, that automates CGM data processing by supporting CGM exports in various file and table formats and turning them into harmonized datasets with additional documentation making every step traceable. Moreover, GluCINDa has a user-friendly interface with simple and advanced modes to meet project-specific needs. GluCINDa, therefore, reduces time required for data preparation, prevents (human) errors and dataloss and, consequently, enhances overall scientific quality and rigor in diabetes research.
