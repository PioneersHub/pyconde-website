abstract:

Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems provide real-time measurements every 5-15 minutes via a small sensor placed under the skin. Interstitial glucose measured with CGM sensors is a reliable proxy for blood glucose, thus reducing the need for frequent fingerpricks. The rich datasets generated by CGM systems are invaluable for both clinical care and diabetes research. However, CGM exports – even though available in CSV or XLSX formats – are often inconsistent, non-machine-readable and lack metadata, making data preparation time-consuming and error-prone. 

To address these challenges, we developed GluCINDa (Glucose: Coherent Import. Neat Data.), a Python-based tool, that automates CGM data processing by supporting CGM exports in various file and table formats and turning them into harmonized datasets with additional documentation making every step traceable. Moreover, GluCINDa has a user-friendly interface with simple and advanced modes to meet project-specific needs. GluCINDa, therefore, reduces time required for data preparation, prevents (human) errors and dataloss and, consequently, enhances overall scientific quality and rigor in diabetes research.

full_description:

Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is a major player in diabetes care, providing real-time glucose measurements from the interstitial fluid via a small sensor placed under the skin. Measurements happen every 5 to 15 minutes and serve as a reliable proxy for blood glucose, thus reducing the need for frequent fingerprick tests. CGM systems generate rich datasets that are not only useful for individual disease management and clincial care, but invaluable for diabetes research. However, because CGM data are not originally intended for research purposes, exports from CGM devices and online portals often fail to meet scientific standards. Even though the exports are available in CSV or XLSX format, they are rarely machine-readable, have inconsistent structures and lack metadata or documentation. These challenges make importing, harmonizing and preparing data for research time-consuming, error-prone and vulnerable to data loss.

To address these challenges, we developed GluCINDa (Glucose: Coherent Import. Neat Data.), a Python-based tool designed to automate CGM data processing. GluCINDa supports various file and table formats, detects glucose measurements with associated date and time information, and produces harmonized datasets suitable for research. She also generates comprehensive documentation files, ensuring every parsed value is traceable, alongside summary reports that provide an overview of the extracted data. To make the software accessible to a wide range of users, GluCINDa features a graphical user interface (GUI) with a simple mode for basic tasks and an advanced mode offering customizable settings.

GluCINDa significantly outperforms traditional data import methods, delivering faster processing while minimizing (human) error and preventing data loss from messy input files. By adhering to scientific standards of traceability, transparency, and rigorous documentation, GluCINDa enhances the quality and reliability of CGM data for diabetes research.
