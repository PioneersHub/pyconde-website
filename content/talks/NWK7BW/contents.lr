abstract: The healthcare sector generates vast amounts of unstructured text, presenting challenges in extracting valuable medical information and assigning standardized medical codes. My work investigates the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) and fine-tuned BERT models for Clinical Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Medical Coding in German clinical texts.

By comparing generative LLMs (like Llama-3.1-70B) with domain-specific BERT models (e.g., medBERT.de), I propose a hybrid approach that leverages synthetic data generated by LLMs to enhance the performance of BERT models. Using the Berlin-TÃ¼bingen-Oncology Corpus (BRONCO), my study demonstrates that LLMs offer rapid solutions with minimal data requirements, while fine-tuned BERT models achieve higher recall for complex clinical tasks.

Additionally, I present innovations in structured JSON output and error handling to optimize LLM applications in medical extraction and medical coding tasks, achieving notable precision gains. This work underscores the transformative potential of combining generative and discriminative NLP models for improving clinical text processing in non-English domains, paving the way for efficient, scalable, and domain-specific AI solutions in healthcare.
