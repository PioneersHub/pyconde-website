abstract:

The healthcare sector generates vast amounts of unstructured text, presenting challenges in extracting valuable medical information and assigning standardized medical codes. My work investigates the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) and fine-tuned BERT models for Clinical Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Medical Coding in German clinical texts.

By comparing generative LLMs (like Llama-3.1-70B) with domain-specific BERT models (e.g., medBERT.de), I propose a hybrid approach that leverages synthetic data generated by LLMs to enhance the performance of BERT models. Using the Berlin-Tübingen-Oncology Corpus (BRONCO), my study demonstrates that LLMs offer rapid solutions with minimal data requirements, while fine-tuned BERT models achieve higher recall for complex clinical tasks.

Additionally, I present innovations in structured JSON output and error handling to optimize LLM applications in medical extraction and medical coding tasks, achieving notable precision gains. This work underscores the transformative potential of combining generative and discriminative NLP models for improving clinical text processing in non-English domains, paving the way for efficient, scalable, and domain-specific AI solutions in healthcare.

Introduction
------------

The healthcare industry faces a critical challenge: converting the vast quantities of unstructured clinical text generated daily into actionable insights. German clinical documents, in particular, demand specialized Natural Language Processing (NLP) solutions due to linguistic and regulatory complexities. My worl explores the intersection of generative Large Language Models (LLMs) and fine-tuned BERT models to address two core tasks: Clinical Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Medical Coding. These tasks are pivotal for enhancing patient care, streamlining medical billing, and advancing clinical research.

This research introduces innovative methodologies and evaluates their effectiveness in processing German clinical texts, focusing on three core elements:

1.  Leveraging generative LLMs for rapid entity extraction with minimal training data.

2.  Fine-tuning BERT-based models on domain-specific datasets for improved recall.

3.  Combining synthetic data generation with model fine-tuning to enhance performance.

Through a detailed evaluation using the Berlin-Tübingen-Oncology Corpus (BRONCO), this work establishes benchmarks for Clinical NLP tasks in German and sets the stage for scalable and efficient applications in healthcare.

Challenges in Clinical NLP for German Texts
-------------------------------------------

Clinical texts present unique challenges, especially in the German language:

1.  **Heterogeneous Data Sources**: Documents vary significantly in structure, style, and content, making uniform processing difficult.

2.  **Domain-Specific Terminology**: Medical texts often use highly specialized terms, abbreviations, and shorthand, complicating entity recognition and standardization.

3.  **Data Scarcity and Privacy**: German clinical datasets are limited due to strict data protection regulations, increasing the reliance on synthetic data and domain-specific models.

4.  **Complex Entity Linking**: Mapping clinical entities to standardized medical codes, such as ICD, OPS, and ATC, requires precise contextual understanding.

Methodologies Explored
----------------------

### 1\. Generative LLMs for Clinical NER

LLMs, such as Llama-3.1-70B, OpenBioLLM, and BioMistral, have demonstrated potential for zero-shot and few-shot learning, making them suitable for tasks with limited labeled data. In this work:

-   Prompt engineering is employed to guide LLMs in identifying entities like diagnoses, medications, and treatments.

-   Structured output generation in JSON format is implemented to simplify downstream processing.

-   Error-handling mechanisms are developed to improve consistency, including replaying invalid responses and flagging ambiguous entities.

The results show that LLMs provide rapid and flexible solutions, but their performance varies by entity type. They excel in identifying medications and treatments but struggle with diagnosis-related terms, highlighting the need for fine-tuned models.

### 2\. Fine-Tuned BERT Models

Building on previous research with medBERT.de, this study fine-tunes BERT-based models on the BRONCO dataset:

-   The BERT models are trained to recognize entities in German clinical text, achieving superior recall for complex tasks.

-   Fine-tuning parameters, such as learning rate and batch size, are optimized for clinical NLP tasks.

-   The models' ability to process large text chunks in parallel enhances their efficiency compared to sequential LLM inference.

### 3\. Hybrid Approach: Synthetic Data for Model Augmentation

A novel hybrid approach combines the strengths of LLMs and BERT models:

-   Synthetic data is generated using LLMs with carefully designed prompts in the BIO tagging format.

-   This synthetic data augments the BRONCO training set, improving BERT's performance by up to 4% in precision for diagnosis-related entities.

-   The hybrid approach bridges the gap between generative and discriminative modeling, offering a robust solution for resource-constrained settings.

Key Innovations
---------------

### Structured Output Generation

To ensure reliable and interpretable outputs from LLMs, structured JSON generation is enforced. This includes:

-   Defining strict schemas for entity recognition.

-   Utilizing Python's Pydantic library for schema validation and error handling.

-   Implementing fallback strategies for invalid or incomplete responses.

### Synthetic Data Generation

Synthetic data addresses the scarcity of annotated clinical datasets. By:

-   Generating diverse and high-quality examples tailored to the target domain.

-   Enhancing model generalization and robustness.

### Entity Linking with Cross-Encoders

A critical aspect of this research is Clinical Entity Linking, mapping extracted entities to medical codes (ICD, OPS, ATC). The xMEN framework is fine-tuned with domain-specific encoders, achieving high precision and recall in medical coding tasks.

Evaluation and Results
----------------------

### Performance Metrics

The models are evaluated on precision, recall, and F1-score across three entity types:

1.  **Diagnoses**

2.  **Medications**

3.  **Treatments**

Key findings include:

-   Generative LLMs achieve precision rates of up to 88.4% for medications but underperform in diagnosis recognition.

-   Fine-tuned BERT models excel in recall, particularly for complex entities.

-   The hybrid approach improves overall F1-scores, demonstrating the synergy of combining LLMs with fine-tuned models.

### Computational Efficiency

Inference speed and resource utilization are also analyzed:

-   LLMs offer flexibility but require significant computational resources.

-   BERT models, once fine-tuned, provide faster and more resource-efficient solutions for large-scale deployments.
