abstract: What if your tasks organization is optimized just like a piece of software? In this talk, I will review popular techniques as algorithms – each with its own CPU, RAM, overhead and potential catastrophic performance issues (O(n!)). 

I will dive into algorithmic features of each productivity system, exploring what works, what doesn’t, and when you should garbage collect your tasks. By the end, you’ll see that just like your engineering system, your productivity methods need regular tuning or even debugging.
