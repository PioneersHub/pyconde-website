abstract: Have you ever `pip install <package>` and got cryptic stacktraces like this

```
$ pip install mysqlclient
 ...
        File "setup.py", line 27, in find_package_name
          raise Exception(
      Exception: Can not find valid pkg-config name.
      Specify MYSQLCLIENT_CFLAGS and MYSQLCLIENT_LDFLAGS env vars manually
...
error: subprocess-exited-with-error

 ```
 
 As a next step, you would paste this log on the internet, the answer might include you installing a native package like `apt install libmysqlclient-dev` and the issue resolves.
  
 In this talk, we'll discuss about Python Packages, why such issues arise during their installation, why it's complex to have `pip install(s)` working the same way in every computer, and how can one deal with them in an efficient manner.
