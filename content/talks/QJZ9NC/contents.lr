abstract: This talk introduces a framework for cryptographically verifying computational pipelines in Python. By generating unforgeable proofs at each stage, you can guarantee your results haven't been tampered with or fabricated. Whether you're running machine learning workflows, data transformations, or scientific computations, you'll learn how to implement verification that proves your pipeline executed as intended.
