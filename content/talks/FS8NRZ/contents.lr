abstract: The complexity of bringing ML models into production went really out of the roof in the last few years. Now itâ€™s not just deploying a model from your laptop to the cloud, but includes cars, IoT devices, mobile phones and custom hardware.

And LLMs require a completely new set of capabilities. To manage the cost of the inference, assess drifts and prevent your users from putting glue on Pizzas.
