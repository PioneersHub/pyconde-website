### Vincenzo Ventriglia

A results-driven data professional, focused on hype-free solutions tailored to business needs.

I currently create value at the **National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology**, where I develop machine learning models in the **Space Weather** domain. My work is complemented by finding the hidden stories in data and make them accessible to stakeholders. I studied Physics in Italy (Napoli) and Germany (Frankfurt am Main), previously worked in Analytics within the strategic division of the world's largest professional services network, as well as in the Data Science department of Italy’s leading publishing group.

I am also an organiser of **PyData Roma Capitale**, actively involved in building the local Python and data science community. Outside of work, I enjoy theatre, discussing finance, and learning new languages.

abstract:

Have you ever happened to use GPS and realised that it is not working properly? The Sun could be responsible.

In this talk, I present a **real-world machine learning forecasting system** designed to predict a Space Weather phenomenon affecting GNSS accuracy and radio communications. The system is based on **CatBoost** and integrates data from space- and ground-based observations. **SHAP** is used to debug model behaviour and to build trust in model outputs. The talk focuses on **model design and evaluation choices**, showing how interpretability and uncertainty-aware forecasting can be combined in a real-time operational pipeline.

full_description:

**Space Weather** doesn’t just produce beautiful auroras: it can silently disrupt navigation systems, radio links, and satellite-based technologies we rely on every day.

Travelling Ionospheric Disturbances (TIDs) are wave-like structures in the ionosphere that affect GNSS accuracy and HF communications. From an ML perspective, forecasting TIDs is a challenging rare-event prediction problem involving imbalanced data and heterogeneous physical inputs.

In this talk, I will present an operational machine learning approach developed within the T-FORS project to forecast TID occurrence over Europe. The model is built using **CatBoost** and integrates data from space- and ground-based observations.

The talk focuses on **model design and evaluation choices**. In particular, I will show how **SHAP** can be used to debug model behaviour, validate feature relevance, and build trust in predictions in a high-risk operational context.

Along the way, I’ll share practical engineering lessons on:
- handling class imbalance,
- incorporating domain knowledge into ML pipelines,
- producing **uncertainty-aware outputs** via **Conformal Prediction**, and
- running **interpretable models in real-time forecasting systems**.

The talk is aimed at data scientists and ML practitioners interested in applied forecasting, interpretable models, uncertainty quantification and ML at the boundary between data and physics.
