abstract: In data science, achieving fast performance is just as important as accuracy, especially when users demand quick results. This talk delves into several straightforward but effective techniques for improving performance in data science applications. Drawing on a real-life case in which we needed to accelerate a Panel app, we highlight strategies that led to significant speed improvements. While some techniques are case-specific, most are broadly applicable for enhancing performance across various data-driven projects.
