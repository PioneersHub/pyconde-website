abstract: Traditional API architectures face significant challenges in environments where repetitive and frequent requests are required to retrieve data updates. These request-response mechanisms introduce latency, as clients must continually query the server to check for changes, often receiving redundant or outdated information. This approach leads to increased network overhead, inefficient use of server resources and diminished scalability as the number of clients or requests grows. Additionally, frequent requests expand the attack surface, requiring security measures to mitigate risks such as (un-)authorised access, rate limiting and query sanitisation. Managing all of these inherent problem results in increasingly complex systems to maintain and improve while putting considerable implementation effort onto the customer.
Join to find out how transitioning to a streaming architecture can address these issues by providing proactive, event-based data delivery, reducing latency, minimising redundant processing, enhancing scalability and simplifying security management.
