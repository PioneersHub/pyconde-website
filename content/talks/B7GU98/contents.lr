abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained tremendous popularity over the past two years, with many tech companies rushing to integrate them into their products. However, these applications have often failed or led to embarrassment due to unrealistic expectations and a limited understanding of LLMs’ constraints. This presentation will explore the true capabilities of LLMs through empirical experimentation and scientific rigor. We will investigate whether LLMs can reason, plan, or simply recite information, and uncover the actual level of “intelligence” they possess. By identifying these limitations, we will provide actionable guidelines for effectively applying LLMs, helping you determine when they are suitable for your product and avoid common pitfalls. This session is accessible to anyone considering the integration of LLMs into their work, regardless of technical background.
