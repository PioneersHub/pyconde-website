abstract: Getting clear, actionable specifications from business stakeholders is often challenging — they tend to be abstract, ambiguous, or incomplete. Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATDD) provides a powerful approach to bridge this gap by enabling clear, executable specifications that align business needs with development. In this talk, we’ll explore how Robot Framework, a simple yet powerful tool, can foster collaboration between business and development teams. Through practical examples, we’ll demonstrate how to write effective tests and extend Robot Framework with custom Python libraries to meet project-specific needs. Walk away with insights and tools to transform how teams communicate, develop, and deliver software.
