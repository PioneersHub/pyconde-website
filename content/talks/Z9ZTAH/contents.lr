abstract:

In this talk, Leandro will examine the significant benefits of combining open source principles with artificial intelligence. He will walk through the need for openness in language models to build trust, maintain control, mitigate biases, and achieve true alignment and show how open models are rapidly gaining momentum in the AI landscape, challenging proprietary systems through community-driven innovation. Finally, he will then talk about emerging trends and what the community needs to build for the next generation of models.
