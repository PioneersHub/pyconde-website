abstract: What if machines could not only act but also feel? Tactile sensing gives robots the ability to perceive touch, enabling them to handle delicate objects, recognize textures, and adapt their grip, just like humans. This talk introduces tactile sensing, its evolution, and advancements like vision-based systems, which combine visual and tactile information to enhance adaptability. It will also highlight how Python developers can contribute to this exciting field by leveraging tools like PyTorch for building machine learning models and OpenCV for processing tactile data. By the end, attendees will understand the importance of touch in robotics and the role Python plays in advancing this innovation.
