abstract: Apache Airflow is approaching the 10th anniversary of its initial release, and its development shows no signs of slowing down! A production airflow deployment is a complex piece of engineering, and many common tasks can still be quite difficult to manage. In this talk, we discuss a few Airflow plugins to bridge key gaps and make life easier for engineering and devops alike. In particular, we'll look at plugins for hierarchical central configuration, long-running or "always on" jobs, and integration with common alerting services.
