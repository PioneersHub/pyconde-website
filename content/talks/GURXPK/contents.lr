abstract: The rise of LLMs has elevated prompt engineering as a critical skill in the AI industry, but manual prompt tuning is often inefficient and model-specific. This talk explores various automatic prompt optimization approaches, ranging from simple ones like bootstrapped few-shot to more complex techniques such as MIPRO and TextGrad, and showcases their practical applications through frameworks like DSPy and AdalFlow. By exploring the benefits, challenges, and trade-offs of these approaches, the attendees will be able to answer the question: is prompt engineering dead, or has it just evolved?
