abstract:

Ever mixed conda and pip and ended up with a broken conda environment, yet, swear it worked before? This talk explains why! Learn the difference between pip and conda, what happens when you mix them and how to combine them safely using the latest community developed tools and updates in conda.

full_description:

Users frequently run `pip` inside their `conda` environments, sometimes successfully, sometimes with unintentional consequences. Confusing errors and broken environments often lead users to ask: when is it safe to use `pip` in a `conda` environment, and when is it not?

In this presentation I will answer this question. 

I will begin by discussing the differences between `pip` and `conda` (a question conda maintainers get asked a lot!), starting with the specific use-cases of both tools. 
This will include an “enlightenment” moment: `pip` and `conda` solve slightly different problems, one is a Python package installer, the other is a language agnostic package and environment manager.

I will then explain the differences between `.conda` packages, tarballs, and Python wheels, revealing how these format differences make interoperability difficult and mixing tools unreliable.
Users end up mixing `pip` and `conda` because sometimes the packaging ecosystem leaves them no other choice. Users often report, "I tried installing a package  with `conda`, but it didn't work, so I ran `pip install` instead and it worked”. This mixing, sadly, has consequences, which I refer to as “environmental damage”. 
I will highlight this damage in my talk. 

`pip` and `conda` are two separate ecosystems but over time many community efforts (most recent being `conda-pypi`),  have tried to improve interoperability. I will explain how the latest updates in `conda` along with the features in `conda-pypi` have now made it possible to `conda install` Python wheels from PyPI directly into `conda` environments. Thereby bringing us a step closer to better interoperability. 

I will conclude the presentation with best-practice recommendations for using `pip` and `conda` together. 
By the end of this presentation, users will have learned when to use `pip`, when to use `conda`, why they are different and how to combine them safely.
