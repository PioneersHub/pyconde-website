abstract: My talk explores Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), a model architecture that combines information retrieval and generative models to fulfill a user information need.

The presentation focuses on RAG systems' indexing and retrieval components, covering classical and modern techniques. It discusses various methods for converting textual data into searchable formats and how to leverage those formats to increase the retrieval of relevant documents based on user queries. I will compare different retrieval techniques, highlighting their features, advantages, and disadvantages. I will also showcase a Python implementation of all the discussed techniques and how they compare in performance and efficiency over an annotated dataset.

Participants will gain insights into each technique's unique features, advantages, and limitations, along with guidance on selecting the most appropriate approach for specific tasks and data requirements.
