full_description:

I will demonstrate the concept of Blockchain and cryptography with a practical example on how it can be used to secure any digital information such as a loan credit application or a sales application. In the past, I have successfully demonstrated security information integrity in a loan business and also in drug counterfeiting. There will be a live demonstration of the web app built with python flask framework.
