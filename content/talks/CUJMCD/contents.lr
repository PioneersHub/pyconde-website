abstract: Building performant Python often means reaching for C extensions. This talk explores an alternative: leveraging Rust to create blazing-fast Python modules that also benefit the Rust ecosystem. I will share practical strategies from building `semantic-text-splitter`, a library for fast and accurate text segmentation used in both Python and Rust, demonstrating how to bridge the gap between these two languages and unlock new possibilities for performance and cross-language collaboration.

description: Building performant Python often means reaching for C extensions. But what if you could achieve similar performance with Rust, while also creating a library usable directly within the Rust ecosystem? This talk explores how Rust can be a powerful ally, creating blazing-fast Python modules that benefit both communities. I will share the strategies I use while building and maintaining my package, `semantic-text-splitter`, used for fast and accurate text segmentation, which sees significant usage in both Python and Rust ecosystems.

Some key challenges arise when bridging the gap between these two languages, such as bridging the gap between Rust's generics and Python's dynamic typing, managing data representation and memory across the Python/Rust boundary, and maintaining type hints and documentation across both languages.

But with practical maintenance strategies, these challenges can be overcome. Moreover, you contribute to a growing ecosystem of high-performance Python tools powered by Rust. Join me to learn how to build and maintain dual-language Python/Rust libraries, and discover how this approach can unlock new possibilities for performance and cross-language collaboration.
