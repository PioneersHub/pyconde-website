abstract: Building performant Python often means reaching for C extensions. This talk explores an alternative: leveraging Rust to create blazing-fast Python modules that also benefit the Rust ecosystem. I will share practical strategies from building `semantic-text-splitter`, a library for fast and accurate text segmentation used in both Python and Rust, demonstrating how to bridge the gap between these two languages and unlock new possibilities for performance and cross-language collaboration.
