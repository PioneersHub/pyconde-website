abstract: Not all resources in today’s cloud environments have native Terraform providers. That’s where Python’s Typer library can step in, offering a flexible, production-ready command-line interface (CLI) framework to help fill in the gaps. In this session, we’ll explore how to integrate Typer with Terraform to manage resources that fall outside Terraform’s direct purview. We’ll share a real-life example of how Typer was used alongside Terraform to automate and streamline the management of an otherwise unsupported API. You’ll learn how Terraform can invoke Python scripts—passing arguments and parameters to control complex operations—while still benefiting from Terraform’s declarative model and lifecycle management. We’ll also discuss best practices for defining resource lifecycles to ensure easy maintainability and consistency across deployments. By the end, participants will see how combining Terraform’s robust infrastructure-as-code approach with Python’s versatility and Typer’s user-friendly CLI can create a powerful, cohesive strategy for managing even the trickiest resources in production environments.

description: In this session, we’ll address a common challenge in managing resources and APIs that lack native Terraform providers but still need to integrate seamlessly into your CI/CD pipeline. I’ll demonstrate how Python’s Typer library can help bridge this gap by offering a straightforward yet powerful command-line interface (CLI). I’ll explain how to create and configure Typer applications, pass parameters, and integrate these scripts with Terraform.
