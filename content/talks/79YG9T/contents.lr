abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enabled the generation of highly coherent text, which is nearly indistinguishable from human-written content. While useful in many applications, LLMs can also be used for harmful purposes such as spreading disinformation, automating spam, and fostering plagiarism. This can negatively impact the reputation of companies and undermine the trust of users. To mitigate these risks, various detection methods have been proposed to determine whether a text is created by a machine or a human. 

In this talk, we will discuss differences between AI-generated and human-written texts. Next, we will overview state-of-the-art AI text detectors and discuss their differences, limitations, and empirical performance. We will analyze how detection performance changes depending on the text domain, information available to the detector, prompt complexity, and other factors. Finally, we will also touch on approaches to evade detectors, such as paraphrasing and spoofing.
