abstract:

In this talk, we will have a deeper technical look at AI coding agents, their design, and how they can carry out coding tasks with the support of large language models. We will look at the journey from the user entering a prompt to how it converts to actions in completing the task.

After that, we will look at the impact it could make in the industry, as a developer, whether or not you should use an AI coding agent, and what a user should be cautious of when using suchan  agent.
