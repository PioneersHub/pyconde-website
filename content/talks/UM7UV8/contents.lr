abstract: Introduction: Django framework has gained widespread acceptance and usage by many developers due to its versatility and scalability. 
 Problem: There is certain information scarcity, in applied aspects, with respect to emerging tools like NLP (Natural Language Processing) and their integration with Django.
Information extraction (IE) in NLP is key technology that automatically extracts structured data from unstructured data. 
Solution: Django-ORM(object relational mapping) based data when integrated with NLP tools can become  better organized for a reliable data extraction and analysis, and also may serve a solution for handling AI (Artificial Intelligence) based  large dataset handling. 
Relevance: This approach can create awareness among the audience and IT community about the ways to lessen the complexity involved in extraction and analysis of large datasets from a database embedded in a web. 
Methodology: This approach may involve building and training a NLP model, use of NLP libraries like TextBlob, Textacy, NLTK, Django libraries, ORM, views templates, etc 
Conclusion/Takeaway : Django-NLP integration may serve as a good approach in processing and extracting large datasets from a web. Particularly, this approach may reflect a cross talk between tabular data and NLP. There is a need to further strengthen this exploratory concept as it carries good future implications in Machine learning.
