abstract: Introduction: Django framework has gained widespread acceptance and usage by many developers due to its versatility and scalability. 
 Problem: There is certain information scarcity, in applied aspects, with respect to emerging tools like NLP (Natural Language Processing) and their integration with Django.
Information extraction (IE) in NLP is key technology that automatically extracts structured data from unstructured data. 
Solution: Django-ORM(object relational mapping) based data when integrated with NLP tools can become  better organized for a reliable data extraction and analysis, and also may serve a solution for handling AI (Artificial Intelligence) based  large dataset handling. 
Relevance: This approach can create awareness among the audience and IT community about the ways to lessen the complexity involved in extraction and analysis of large datasets from a database embedded in a web. 
Methodology: This approach may involve building and training a NLP model, use of NLP libraries like TextBlob, Textacy, NLTK, Django libraries, ORM, views templates, etc 
Conclusion/Takeaway : Django-NLP integration may serve as a good approach in processing and extracting large datasets from a web. Particularly, this approach may reflect a cross talk between tabular data and NLP. There is a need to further strengthen this exploratory concept as it carries good future implications in Machine learning.

description: Introduction: Django framework has revolutionized web development in the IT sector globally. It has gained widespread acceptance and usage by many developers due to its versatility and scalability. Particularly documentation on Django has provided the users a know-how of the technology and its applications from beginners to the advanced professionals. Problem: There seems to be a problematic area that needs to be addressed with a solution. The problem is that there is certain information scarcity with respect to emerging areas like NLP (Natural Language Processing) and its integration with Django. Although this integration concept has been introduced several years ago, it still requires input in terms of practical feasibility in real life scenarios like healthcare domain. There seems to be knowledge deficit problem in this area. 
Body:
NLP refers to an Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology that enables computers understand and process natural languages in spoken or text form. Especially, NLP has several facets with regard to the processing of large amounts of text or data. For instance, information extraction (IE) in NLP is  key technology that automatically extracts structured data from unstructured data. It can recognize and pull out particular data like dates, names, relationships and many more and organizes them. ORM(object relational mapping)  tables when used in Django could generate tabular data, say, patient data in this case. But this tabular data, needs some integration with analytical tool to organize them for a quick analysis.
Relevance of the problem to the audience:
The problem is relevant to audience or the IT community because they need approaches that can lessen the complexity involved in extraction ad analysis of large datasets from a database. This in turn can help them in better organization, planning and decision making.
Solution to the problem:
The solution to the problem is building and training a NLP model, developing  a Django view for NLP Integration, using NLP libraries like TextBlob, Textacy, NLTK etc  to process the input text data(patient data, for example).Then install needed Django libraries, create ORM, views or APIs for processing data input , running NLP tasks for recognizing  and classifying named entities, and obtain the final output in the form of template.

Conclusion/ takeaway:
Django-NLP integration is an emerging field with regard to processing and extraction of large datasets particularly when dealing with public databases like patient data in hospitals. This approach may serve a solution for handling AI (Artificial Intelligence) based  large dataset handling. This can guide the doctors to come up with better diagnosis and treatment plans. This approach of cross talk between Django tabular data and NLP may  guide the data scientists  for exploratory data analysis (EDA) in Machine learning.
