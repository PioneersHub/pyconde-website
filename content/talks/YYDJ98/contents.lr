Remember when command-line interfaces were just plain text and simple ASCII art? It’s time to level up those terminal skills with Textual, the modern Python TUI framework.

In this tutorial, we’ll build a sleek, interactive CLI-based schedule app for PyCon 2025. Whether you’re an experienced engineer or new to coding, you’ll learn how to create stunning text-based apps.

We’ll start with the basics: adding color to your terminal using escape sequences. Next, I’ll introduce Textual and show you how to move from static, rich terminal output to fully interactive applications. Together, we’ll then explore Textual’s capabilities, including widgets, styling, and events. Finally, we will apply everything we learned and put together a scheduling app for the PyCon 2025.

Let’s bring some magic to the terminal!
