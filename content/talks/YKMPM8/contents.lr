Counteracting the overarching narative of AI taking over all our jobs, this talk will offer some guidance and tips on how to grow your career in this brave new world. LLMs and other forms of AI are here to stay, and rather than worry about the existential threat to our livelihoods we should look to see how they can be harnessed to further grow our careers.

full_description:

Rather than worrying about the existential threat that AI poses, Iâ€™ll offer some practical guidance on how to thrive in this environment. What is unlikely to change is the requirement for engineers to solve thorny problems. Key to having long careers is to shift our mindset to use these technologies to augment our careers and work, rather than handing over all work to them. Approaching this technology shift with a growth mindset is key to leveraging all the benefits of this new paradigm, and rather than replacing our jobs, could help accelerate our careers and remove toil from our daily work. 

It is also helpful to see the latest technology shifts as part of a larger continuum of technoical advancement in our field. The cummulative effect of which has helped drive speed and quality improvements at the same time as lowering the barrier to entry for aspiring engineers.
