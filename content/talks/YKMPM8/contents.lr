abstract: Counteracting the overarching narative of AI taking over all our jobs, this talk will offer some guidance and tips on how to grow your career in this brave new world. LLMs and other forms of AI are here to stay, and rather than worry about the existential threat to our livelihoods we should look to see how they can be harnessed to further grow our careers.
