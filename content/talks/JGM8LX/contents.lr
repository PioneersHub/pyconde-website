abstract: cluster-experiments is a library that helps analysts design, run, and analyze AB tests. It allows users to create AB test scorecards from AB test data, calculate MDEs given historical data using the Central Limit Theorem, and calculate statistical power via simulations. All of this can be done for many experiment designs (clustered, switchback) and analysis techniques (variance reduction, delta method, GEE). This library has been used in Delivery Hero as well as other companies to design and analyze AB tests.
