abstract: cluster-experiments is a library that helps analysts design, run, and analyze AB tests. It allows users to create AB test scorecards from AB test data, calculate MDEs given historical data using the Central Limit Theorem, and calculate statistical power via simulations. All of this can be done for many experiment designs (clustered, switchback) and analysis techniques (variance reduction, delta method, GEE). This library has been used in Delivery Hero as well as other companies to design and analyze AB tests.

description: Power analysis is a critical step in AB testing design. Many analysts routinely use calculators to run power analysis. However, these calculators fail to cover many important cases, including cases when: some non-parametric analysis method like bootstrap is used to run the hypothesis test; adding covariates to reduce variance (cuped or cupac rely on this); running clustered designs, where the unit of analysis is different than the unit of treatment assignment. cluster-experiments is a library that allows us to run power analysis for any experiment design. Also, in the spirit of "analyse as you design", cluster-experiments allows you to do AB test analysis using the same methods you used to design the experiment.
