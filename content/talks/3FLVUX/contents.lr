abstract: Everyone knows the dunder method `__init__`.
Even if you don't understand how it works, you know you're supposed to use it to initialise attributes of your instances.

But have you heard of `__init__`'s big brother, `__new__`?

This live-coded talk shows you what the dunder method `__new__` does and how it works based on a real-world use case from the standard library.

Join and dip your toes in the world of metaprogramming in Python!
