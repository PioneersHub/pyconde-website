abstract: In hypothesis testing the stopping criterion for data collection is a non-trivial question that puzzles many analysts. This is especially true with sequential testing where demands for quick results may lead to biassed ones. 

I show how the belief that Bayesian approaches magically resolve this issue is misleading and how to obtain reliable outcomes by focusing on sample precision as a goal.

In particular  introduce benefits of a novel approach called *Enhanced Precision is the Goal*.
