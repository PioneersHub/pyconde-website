### Giancarlo Mattia

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg. I am currently investigating the impact of non-ideal processes within protostellar and protoplanetary disks on their formation, evolution, and production of winds and collimated outflows.

abstract:

Modern scientific workflows increasingly rely on interactive analysis, reproducibility, and high-quality visualisation. **PyPLUTO** is a Python package designed to explore, analyse, and visualise numerical simulations produced by the **PLUTO** code for computational astrophysics. This talk shows how *PyPLUTO* leverages the Python ecosystem to transform raw simulation outputs into clear, flexible analysis and visualization workflows.

The session demonstrates how domain-specific simulation data can be integrated with tools such as `NumPy` and `Matplotlib` to support efficient post-processing, rapid exploration, and production of publication-quality figures. Attendees will see how structured Python workflows can replace fragmented, ad-hoc scripts, how visualisation accelerates scientific insight, and how Python lowers the barrier between simulation output and interpretation.

Although examples are drawn from computational astrophysics, the approach is broadly applicable to any field working with structured simulation data. The talk highlights how lightweight, Python-based post-processing tools can improve clarity, reproducibility, and productivity without imposing heavy frameworks or tightly coupled visualisation pipelines.

full_description:

Numerical simulations often generate vast amounts of structured data; yet, extracting insights from these outputs remains a major challenge. Analysis is frequently performed through fragmented, ad-hoc scripts that are difficult to maintain, reuse, or reproduce. **PyPLUTO** is a Python package designed to address this gap by providing a clear and flexible interface for post-processing, analyzing, and visualizing simulation data produced by the **PLUTO** code for computational astrophysics.

This talk presents **PyPLUTO** as a case study in building lightweight, domain-specific scientific tools on top of the Python scientific ecosystem. The emphasis is on offline analysis and visualisation workflows that operate on completed simulation outputs, enabling efficient exploration, comparison, and communication of results. Rather than coupling visualisation to simulation runtime, **PyPLUTO** focuses on clarity, composability, and integration with established PyData libraries.

Through concrete examples, the session demonstrates how structured simulation data can be processed and visualised using tools such as NumPy and Matplotlib. Attendees will learn how Python-based workflows can replace scattered analysis scripts, how visualization supports rapid scientific insight, and how a clean separation between simulation and analysis enhances reproducibility and productivity.
