abstract: NeuroAI is an emerging area of research into the fundamental principles of cognition and intelligence shared by living organisms and AI.

There is still a large conceptual gap between brains and machine learning models. The brain forms abstractions and learns continuously within a single life-time, while machine learning has focused on large data-sets and static function approximation. How can this gap be bridged?

Learn about the key topics, challenges and intriguing work in the emerging area of NeuroAI (and pickup some ideas about the future of AI along the way!)

description: NeuroAI is an emerging area of research into the fundamental principles of cognition and intelligence shared by living organisms and AI. Most significant developments in the history of AI have been inspired by biology; there are still many systems and properties of the brain that are yet to be replicated in AI algorithms. There continues to be a large conceptual gap between brains and machine learning models. The brain forms abstractions and learns continuously within a single life-time, while machine learning has focused on large data-sets and static function approximation. How can this gap be bridged?

Despite the recent commercial success of large language models; these models are still brittle and resource hungry. While creating something with the capabilities of an LLM is impressive, reaching this point required training on dumps of the entire internet and whole libraries of books; even then progress has slowed as the "fossil fuel" of text written by humans is exhausted.

The bridge between AI and neuroscience is once again a promising path to walk. Understanding and then replicating the brain's ability to learn rapidly, flexibly and to create abstractions is as exciting and important as ever. This talk introduces the field of NeuroAI, discusses the upcoming challenges in the field, explores the intriguing and exciting successes and reflects on how this approach will shape the future of AI.
