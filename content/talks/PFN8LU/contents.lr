full_description:

The fusion of AI and real-time data has paved the way for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), a powerful method for building context-aware, responsive applications. This session will take participants on a journey to develop RAG-based applications using Python and Couchbase, focusing on practical implementation and best practices.

Key topics include:
Introduction to RAG: Understand how RAG enables the combination of language models and real-time contextual data.
Vector Search and Embeddings: Learn to generate, store, and search embeddings efficiently with Couchbase and Python libraries.
Processing Unstructured Data: See how to convert unstructured data into usable chunks for improved language model performance.
Building RAG Applications: Step-by-step guidance on integrating AI-driven workflows with a modern NoSQL database for scalability and performance.

Attendees will gain actionable insights into building robust RAG workflows that address challenges like context loss in large language models and the need for up-to-date data. The session will include live demonstrations, code walkthroughs, and architectural patterns to help you implement RAG in your own projects. This talk is ideal for Python developers, data engineers, and AI enthusiasts looking to integrate cutting-edge AI capabilities into their applications.
