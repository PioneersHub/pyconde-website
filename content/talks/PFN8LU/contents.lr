abstract: Unlock the potential of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to create intelligent applications that seamlessly combine language models with real-time data. In this session, weâ€™ll explore how Python, Couchbase, and vector search come together to build scalable RAG solutions. Learn how to manage embeddings, integrate unstructured data, and enhance AI applications by leveraging the power of modern data platforms. With live demos and practical insights, this talk is perfect for developers looking to bridge the gap between AI and real-world data needs.
