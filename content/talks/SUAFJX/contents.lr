abstract: In December 2024, The Python Quants celebrated its 20th company anniversary. This talk reflects on two decades of leveraging Python in the financial industry, highlighting the evolution of the ecosystem, key milestones, and the role education has played in shaping this journey. Drawing from my experiences as the author of seven books on Python for Finance and as an educator and consultant, I will share insights into past developments and future trends in this transformative domain.
