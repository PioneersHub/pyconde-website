abstract: Are you frustrated with complex JavaScript frameworks? Tired of hitting walls with inflexible Python web tools? Want to build web apps without leaving the Python ecosystem?

FastHTML, created by Fast.ai and Answer.ai founder Jeremy Howard, is revolutionizing Python web development. Built on the same foundation as FastAPI (Starlette) and supercharged by HTMX, it brings modern web capabilities to Python developers.

Unlike many popular higher-level python web development tools, FastHTML grows with your needs. No more rewriting applications when you outgrow your framework's limitations.

In this talk you'll discover:

1. How FastHTML enables production-ready web apps in pure Python
2. Why its architecture makes it both simple to start and infinitely extensible
3. Real-world examples of FastHTML in action
4. The philosophy behind "hackable" web development

Join us for 90 minutes of practical, hands-on learning that will transform how you think about web development with Python!
