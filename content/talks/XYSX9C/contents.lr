abstract:

ColPali is revolutionary—here’s why: it combines document retrieval with a vision-based large language model, allowing you to search directly within images without needing to extract text. However, running the full model on personal hardware can be challenging due to its computational demands. And thus we’ve released a quantized version of ColPali.

full_description:

ColPali is a late interaction model, that is the context remain intact. And it's finetuned on vision LLM, Pali Gemma to be able to perform text search on images. But what we did was to be able to bring it more towards consumer by quantizing the model, so you can perform search locally on your laptop.

The talk will cover:
What is ColPali?
What is Late-Interaction?
What is Quantization of model, and how to perform it?
How you can deploy it on locally?
