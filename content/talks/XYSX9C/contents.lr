abstract: ColPali is revolutionary—here’s why: it combines document retrieval with a vision-based large language model, allowing you to search directly within images without needing to extract text. However, running the full model on personal hardware can be challenging due to its computational demands. And thus we’ve released a quantized version of ColPali.
