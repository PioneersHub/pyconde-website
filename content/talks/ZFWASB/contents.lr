abstract:

AI systems face six dimensions of scale: data, model, user, operational, infrastructure, and cost. While most talks focus on infrastructure and user scale, this session tackles the hardest dimension: Cost Scale, maintaining predictable and optimized compute costs as usage grows. Drawing from production experience, I'll demonstrate how I achieved 70% cost reduction through three architectural patterns: semantic caching that eliminates repeat LLM calls, model cascading using hybrid architecture (open-source SLMs + API-based LLMs), and optimized conversation state management. 
You'll see real production metrics, honest failure post-mortems, and the critical trade-offs between batch vs. real-time inference, monolithic vs. microservices, and open-source vs. API models. Learn how architectural choices directly impact unit economics, and why scaling AI is fundamentally different from scaling traditional software. 
Walk away with reusable Python patterns (FastAPI, Pydantic, Redis, DynamoDB) and decision frameworks for building economically sustainable agentic AI systems.

full_description:

The Cost Scale Problem
AI systems must scale across six dimensions: data, model, user, operational, infrastructure, and cost. While traditional software scales by adding servers, AI systems have non-linear cost curves that can destroy unit economics overnight.
This talk focuses on Cost Scale, maintaining predictable compute costs as usage grows. 
What You'll Learn (40 min + Q&A)
Why AI Scaling Is Different (5 min)
1. Traditional vs. AI systems: learning, degradation, token-based pricing
2. The six dimensions of the scale framework
3. Real economics: €50/month → €15,000/month → €4,500/month optimized

Architecture Foundation (4 min)
1. Monolithic vs. microservices for AI
2. Event-driven architecture choice
3. Batch vs. real-time inference trade-offs

Pattern 1: Semantic Caching (12 min)
1. Vector-based query matching with Redis
2. Architecture walkthrough and code examples
3. Production metrics: 72% hit rate, $0.001 vs. $0.015 per query
4. Failures: threshold tuning (0.95 → 0.85), semantic false positives

Pattern 2: Model Cascading - Hybrid Architecture (12 min)
1. Open-source (Llama 3.2) + API (Claude/GPT-4) strategy
2. Semantic router implementation with Pydantic
3. Code examples: routing logic, confidence scoring, fallbacks
4. Production metrics: 40% cost reduction through intelligent routing

Pattern 3: Conversation State (8 min)
1. Multi-tier storage: Redis (hot) + DynamoDB (warm/cold)
2. Context window management and summarisation
3. Production metrics: storage vs. token cost trade-offs

Integration & Monitoring (3 min)
1. Full system architecture
2. FinOps dashboards and cost alerting
3. Final results: 70% reduction, sub-2s latency, 0.3% error rate

Takeaways (3 min)
1. Decision frameworks for each pattern
2. Open-source vs. API vs. hybrid criteria
3. GitHub repo with reference implementations

Who Should Attend
Engineers moving AI to production, platform teams managing costs, managers evaluating AI feasibility. Basic Python and LLM knowledge helpful.

Technologies
Python, FastAPI, Pydantic, Redis, DynamoDB, sentence-transformers, Llama 3.2, Claude/GPT-4.

Why It Matters
Production-tested patterns with real metrics, honest failures, and actionable frameworks for building economically sustainable AI systems.
