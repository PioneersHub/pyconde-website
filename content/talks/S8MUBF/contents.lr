abstract: "Why Exceptions Are Just Sophisticated Gotos - and How to Move Beyond" explores a common programming tool with a fresh perspective.

This talk examines those parallels, the problems exceptions can create, and practical alternatives for better code. Attendees will gain a clear understanding of modern programming concepts and the evolution of programming.
