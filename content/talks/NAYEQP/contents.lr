abstract: Have you ever been in the “educational” situation where your carefully crafted venv refused to install as soon as your colleague tried it on a different OS?

Have you ever happily installed dependencies from requirements.txt, only to be greeted later by obscure warnings from some random library—because, for example, you used Python 3.9 instead of Python 3.10?

Have you ever felt your heart rate spike at the thought of running conda install in an environment full of pip installs?

Yeah, me too. And not only once. 

Maybe you’ve heard about the new cool kid in town, `uv`. I recently gave it a try and it was instant love - I have never gotten that excited about a Python tool in my life!

In this talk, I’ll share my first-hand experience with `uv` as a data scientist: how I use it, how it simplifies dependency management, and the cool Python features I discovered while tinkering with it. Since uv is (practically) inseparable from `pyproject.toml`, we’ll also learn about this fantastic standard and how using both together can make deploying your code a breeze.

DISCLAIMER: I am in no way associated with `uv`’s authors. I just think they built a phenomenal tool. All opinions expressed here are my own.
