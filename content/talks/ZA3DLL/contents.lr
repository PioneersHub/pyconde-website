abstract:

Data analytics isn’t always done in a dedicated analytics database. The business wants to glean insights and value from the data that’s generated over time by its OLTP applications, and the simplest way to do that is often just to run analytics queries directly on the application database.

The database and code are probably optimised for performance of the day-to-day application activity. Someone may have spent many hours, weeks or months getting things to that state. But now, you’re being asked to run complex analytics queries against this carefully tuned database!

Fortunately, there are some tools and techniques that you can use to optimise your database for an analytics workload without compromising the performance of your existing application.

Data analytics isn’t always done in a dedicated analytics database. The business wants to glean insights and value from the data that’s generated over time by its OLTP applications, and the simplest way to do that is often just to run analytics queries directly on the application database.  But the database and code are probably optimised for performance of the day-to-day application activity, and performance is likely to take a hit if you suddenly add complex analytics queries to the mix.

In this talk, we'll discuss the challenges associated with running data analytics on an existing OLTP database. We'll look at some of the impacts this type of workload could have on the application, and why it could cause the analytics queries themselves to perform poorly.

We'll then look at some of the strategies, tools and techniques that you can use to optimise your database for an analytics workload without compromising the performance of your application. This will include architecture choices, configuration parameters, materialized views and more.
