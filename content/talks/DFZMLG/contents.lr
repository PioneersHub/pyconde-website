abstract: The city of Munich offers extensive information about municipal services on its website, but findability is often a problem. This talk presents a solution: an AI-based search with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) that can process questions in natural language.

The topic is relevant as many stakeholders face similar challenges. The presentation explains the implementation using open source components, the step-by-step improvement of the search function and the monitoring during operation. Participants will learn how to build, optimise and monitor an AI-based search.
