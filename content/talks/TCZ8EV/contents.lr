abstract: Some people are a big fan of AI, they are seeing an avalanche of new and exciting opportunities. Others are afraid of AI and the impact on their jobs and their lives in general. Afraid of their 'imagination' AI will help governments, companies and surveillance to control their lives.

One of the biggest foundations of anxiety is the lack of understanding and knowledge about a specific topic or scenario. In this talk we are going to use the Iceberg Methodology to understand some of the most common fears and anxieties about AI. What's below the surface? What's the real fear? What's the real problem?

How do we use the Iceberg Methodology to coach people finding out what AI is all about? How do we help them to understand AI and its impact? Can we help them to see the opportunities next to the risks? And how do we use some of their ground fears to adjust the models and algorithms to make them feel more trustworthy for more people?

This talk is about mixing AI knowledge and coaching skills.
