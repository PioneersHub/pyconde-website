abstract: Vector databases are widely recognized as tools for similarity search, for example, in trendy (Agentic) Retrieval Augmented Generation. Yet, few pay attention to vector databases' feature - the ability to determine DISsimilarity. With similarity and dissimilarity, vector databases can be used to analyze billions of data points to detect anomalies and outliers, classify unstructured data, perform variety sampling and discovery search, and, in general, discover hidden patterns in data. This talk will demonstrate using vector databases as a big data analysis tool.

description: Vector databases store vector representations (embeddings) of diverse data modalities (text, images, audio, etc). These embeddings capture objects' semantic informationâ€”regardless of data modality or, for example, language. That's why vector databases are widely used for semantic similarity search. Lately, this capability has made them a popular choice as a backbone of (Agentic) Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, where they serve as knowledge bases.
Yet, vector databases can do far more than just similarity-based lookups. Their often overlooked strength is their ability to measure dissimilarity.
One can transform vector databases into large-scale data analysis tools that handle billions of data points by using similarity and dissimilarity.  
This tool can perform anomaly and outlier detection, variety sampling, recommendations, discovery search, etc.
This talk will discuss best practices for using vector databases as big data analysis engines/tools. You'll come away with a new perspective on how to use similarity and dissimilarity to solve real-world problems on a massive scale.
