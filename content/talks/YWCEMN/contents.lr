abstract: Vector databases are widely recognized as tools for similarity search, for example, in trendy (Agentic) Retrieval Augmented Generation. Yet, few pay attention to vector databases' feature - the ability to determine DISsimilarity. With similarity and dissimilarity, vector databases can be used to analyze billions of data points to detect anomalies and outliers, classify unstructured data, perform variety sampling and discovery search, and, in general, discover hidden patterns in data. This talk will demonstrate using vector databases as a big data analysis tool.
