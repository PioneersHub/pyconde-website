abstract: In this talk, we show how to leverage publicly available tools to control any game or program using hand or body movements. To achieve this, we introduce PosePIE, an open-source programmable input emulator that generates input events on virtual gamepads, keyboards and mice based on gestures recognized by using AI-driven pose estimation. PosePIE is fully configurable by the user through Python scripts, making it easily adaptable to new applications.
