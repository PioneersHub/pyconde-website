abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is one of the most popular applications of generative AI in the industry. In this talk, we will provide practical insights on how to build better conversational assistants that leverage RAG to tap into your companyâ€™s data and provide accurate answers on user questions. 

We will discuss important techniques to improve the quality of RAG chatbots that we learned from the practical experience of building generative AI solutions and scientific literature. The talk will cover tips for improving retrievers, including features like hybrid search, nested chunking, reranking, and others. We will also discuss improvements to the answer generation, including prompt engineering and caching.
