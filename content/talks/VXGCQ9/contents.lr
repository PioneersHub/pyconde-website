abstract:

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is one of the most popular applications of generative AI in the industry. In this talk, we will provide practical insights on how to build better conversational assistants that leverage RAG to tap into your company’s data and provide accurate answers on user questions. 

We will discuss important techniques to improve the quality of RAG chatbots that we learned from the practical experience of building generative AI solutions and scientific literature. The talk will cover tips for improving retrievers, including features like hybrid search, nested chunking, reranking, and others. We will also discuss improvements to the answer generation, including prompt engineering and caching.

full_description:

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is one of the most popular applications of generative AI in the industry. Despite the novelty of RAG, many theoretical and empirical studies have been published recently, discussing the performance and implementation of RAG chatbots in different domains.

This talk will provide practical insights on how to build better conversational assistants that leverage RAG to tap into your company’s data and provide accurate answers on user questions. We will combine insights from the scientific literature and our practical experience from building chatbots for different customers to focus on the most impactful RAG techniques that work in practice.

The talk will cover tips for improving RAG retrievers, including features like hybrid search, nested chunking, reranking, adding meta-data to chunks, and others. We will also discuss improvements to the answer generation, including prompt engineering, caching, and more. Finally, we will also touch on how to reliably evaluate RAG chatbots.
