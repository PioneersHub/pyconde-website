abstract: Fairness and safety are fundamental criteria for building trustworthy and high-quality AI systems, whether they are credit scoring models, hiring assistants, or healthcare chatbots. But what does it truly mean for an AI system to be fair and safe? In this talk, I will explore the potential risks and challenges associated with these principles and introduce various approaches and techniques for evaluating AI systems. The discussion will center on applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), highlighting their unique considerations and implications.
