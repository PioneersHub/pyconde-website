abstract: Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) enhance traditional neural networks by providing uncertainty estimates in predictions, making them ideal for applications where confidence quantification is crucial. This talk offers a conceptual overview of BNNs, with minimal mathematical detail, and concludes with a practical demo using a simple dataset. This talk is beginner friendly.
