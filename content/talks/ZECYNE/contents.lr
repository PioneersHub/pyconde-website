full_description:

Two years ago, we embarked on a bold migration from running Python applications on Kubernetes to adopting AWS Lambda as our primary runtime. This transition has been a transformative journey, reshaping how we think about scalability, deployment, and developer productivity in the serverless era.

In this talk, I’ll share the key lessons we’ve learned along the way. We’ll dive into the challenges of moving away from containerized Python workloads to a serverless architecture, the strategies we used to overcome them, and the unexpected benefits that emerged. Topics include optimizing cold starts, managing ephemeral environments, integrating Python’s ecosystem into serverless workflows, and developer experience.

Whether you’re contemplating a similar migration or looking to refine your existing serverless setup, this session will provide actionable insights and best practices drawn from real-world experience. Join me to uncover what worked, what didn’t, and how Python thrives in the serverless age.
