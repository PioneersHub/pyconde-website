abstract: Two years ago, we migrated from Python on Kubernetes to AWS Lambda, embracing serverless architecture. In this talk, I’ll share our journey, including lessons learned, challenges faced, and unexpected benefits. From cold start optimizations to integrating Python’s ecosystem and developer experience, this session offers practical insights for anyone adopting or optimizing serverless Python. Join me to explore what worked, what didn’t, and how serverless has transformed our approach to building scalable Python applications.
