abstract:

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has emerged as a standard for connecting Large Language Models with diverse data sources and enabling interactions with other systems. In this talk, we’ll introduce the MCP standard and demonstrate how to build  a MCP Server using real world examples. We’ll then explore its applications, showing how it empowers developers and makes data from complex systems accessible to non-technical users. Finally, we’ll dive into recent protocol updates, including improvements to Streamable HTTP transport and security enhancements, and share practical strategies for deploying MCP servers as well as clients.
