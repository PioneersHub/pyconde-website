abstract:

The European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) are now in effect, requiring most companies across the EU to report on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors in a more structured and extensive way. In this talk, I will break down the key aspects of ESRS and explain why data scientists are in a strong position to help drive sustainability reporting within their organizations.

The European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) are now in effect, requiring most companies across the EU to report on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors. These standards aim to increase transparency and accountability, requiring businesses to disclose data that reflects their sustainability efforts in both quantitative and qualitative ways. Companies must report on a vast number of specific ESG metrics, as well as provide descriptions of their actions, goals, and plans in these areas.

In this talk, I will explore how data scientists are in a unique position to support organizations in navigating the ESRS. The standards require data professionals to handle both quantitative metrics—like carbon emissions, energy use and other performance indicators—and qualitative data such as action plans, sustainability goals, and strategies. I want to demonstrate where we as data scientists can bridge the gap between raw data and actionable insights, ensuring accuracy in reporting, developing workflows for data integration, and helping our organizations articulate their sustainability efforts effectively.

I will also highlight some of the key challenges companies face when gathering and reporting ESG data, such as data gaps, inconsistencies, and the complexities of integrating data from different sources. By the end of the talk, I hope that you will have a clearer understanding of sustainability reporting and how you could help organizations meet these new standards.
