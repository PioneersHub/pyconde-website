abstract: The European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) are now in effect, requiring most companies across the EU to report on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors in a more structured and extensive way. In this talk, I will break down the key aspects of ESRS and explain why data scientists are in a strong position to help drive sustainability reporting within their organizations.
