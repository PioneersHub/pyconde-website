abstract: The general medical advice for diseases, symptoms and treatments is to never ask it to Dr. Google. It's a bad idea to explore symptoms and clinical presentations on the internet. On the other hand: 'general' advices are good for the majority. There are always exceptions. This talk is how I used Generative AI next to a brilliant medical team to help me to get cured from a rare disease called 'Zinner Syndrome'.

The first thing my GP said to me: Do look up as much as you can on the internet. I said: really? He said: yes, you are a smart guy. You know how to use it for the better. After some basic YouTube presentation hunting and some basic Google searches I asked the same stuff to Microsoft Copilot.

I started to make a repository on GitHub with MarkDown files. I enabled GitHub Copilot and generated my journey. Reports from appointments to doctors, examinations, treatments, and results. I used the system to track the use of medication, the impact on my body and the impact on my mental being. I even used the GitHub mobile app during my doctor appointments.

Come and learn in this talk about a unique use case of technology to get better!

A talk showing that demonstrates how you can use tools on an out-of-the-box way. The talk will be demo and code heavy. But the fact the code is only Markdown should make it easy for everyone to follow. You don't need to be an experienced coder to understand the concepts I speak about and to understand the unique way of handling such tools.
