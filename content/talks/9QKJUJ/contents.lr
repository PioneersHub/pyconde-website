abstract: The  World Health Organization reports that nearly 60% of low-income countries lack enough healthcare workers, leaving essential diagnostic needs unmet.
This simply implies that in areas with limited resources, poor connectivity and lack of infrastructure make traditional cloud-based AI solutions to healthcare impractical. This is where edge AI steps in, it offers a practical approach to bringing AI capabilities directly to edge devices ( smartphones, drones or even industrial robots ).

In this talk, I will educate people on how lightweight AI models can be deployed on edge devices to enable diagnostic support in  healthcare, and provide  help where itâ€™s needed.  Using Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX), I will show how to optimize machine learning models for significant applications such as detecting abnormalities all without reliance on cloud dependent systems.
