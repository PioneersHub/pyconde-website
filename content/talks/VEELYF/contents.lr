abstract: AI agents, powered by LLMs, are transforming modern applications by not only understanding context but also interacting with systems and files seamlessly. Open-source AI agent frameworks like Ai16z are democratizing access to these capabilities, enabling developers to build intelligent systems that maintain context and interact meaningfully across platforms.

This talk is about the pivotal role of vector databases in building scalable, robust memory systems for AI agents. We'll explore how distributed architectures, real-time search, and vector similarity matching empower agents to efficiently store, retrieve, and leverage contextual information across massive datasets with millisecond-level performance., We'll examine how database adapters provide a vital persistence layer for AI agents, enabling them to store relationships, manage memories, and handle complex interactions across multiple systems.
