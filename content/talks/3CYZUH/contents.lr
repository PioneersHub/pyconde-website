abstract: Many managed MLOps platforms, while convenient, often fall short in providing flexibility, requiring complex integrations, and causing vendor lock-in. In this talk, we’ll share our experience transitioning from managed MLOps tools to a self-hosted solution built on Kubernetes. We’ll focus on how we leveraged open-source tools like Feast, MLflow, and Ray to build a more flexible, scalable, and customizable platform that is now in use at Rewe Digital. By migrating to this self-hosted architecture, we gained greater control over our ML pipelines, reduced our dependency on third-party services, and created a more adaptable infrastructure for our ML workloads.
