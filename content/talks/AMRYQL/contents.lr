abstract: There is no single RAG system that will suddenly solve all your problems. Although there are a lot of promises around integrating a chat window in your application and suddenly being blessed with happy users, this is unfortunately not the case. It is crucial to understand what the user needs to make the most of these new technologies. In our talk we will explore different aspects centered around the User Interface of a RAG system that will help you to build more effective machine learning systems. Concretely we will explore the following topics: 

1. Balancing Human and Machine Intelligence in RAG Systems: Provide effective but safe workflows through balancing user control and automation.
2. Building Trust Through Transparency and Explainability: Increase safety and build user trust through traceable decisions.
3. Designing Intuitive and Usable Interfaces for Diverse Users: Reducing cognitive load and adapting to user needs.
4. Feedback and Iteration Loops for Continuous Improvement: Refine your system over time and improve alignment with user expectations.

For each of those we will show you typical pitfalls to avoid and patterns to follow for leveling up your RAG systems and improving the experience for your users. Additionally, we will also provide you with concrete suggestions for implementation, using open-source tooling.
