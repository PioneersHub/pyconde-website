abstract: The go-to solution for Celery monitoring is flower. If you're inside the AWS ecosystem, combining AWS Firehose, S3, Athena, and Grafana can be a great choice for implementing your Celery monitoring. In this talk, I'll show you how to set that up for good.

We'll discuss why we need to monitor our tasks and which things we should monitor. We'll briefly discuss the flower and its limitations.

## Celery events - 5min
We'll discuss how Celery communicates the state of tasks - sent, received, started, ... We'll take a look at how to subscribe to Celery's events with code.

## AWS Firehose, S3, Athena, Grafana - 5min
I'll briefly present each tool and its role in our monitoring. We'll also discuss their limitations.


## Implementing monitoring - 25min
We'll look at how to set up all the AWS tools using Terraform. We'll also set up a Celery events listener to send Celery's Events to our monitoring solution. We'll also create some plots inside Grafana to monitor some actual executions of jobs.
