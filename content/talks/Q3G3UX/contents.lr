abstract:

You got your beautiful Python code running on your computer and you want to share it with a world. In this talk talk I'll step by step in fastest way possible to get your code running on AWS as cheap as possible and give you advice on how to scale it when time comes.
Main goal is to push your code to github repo, grab a cup of tea/coffee while your pipeline do your work and return to your changes running on cloud.

full_description:

In this talk we will go over:
- Working with containers and making your docker file
- Setting up GitHub actions
- CDK and Python (lets use Python to setup our cloud instead of clicking in AWS website)
- Setting up permissions and credentials
- Setting up database (why use RDS)
- Setting up ECS (AWS container services)
- Getting your load balancer up and running
- Generating certificates (so we have nice https for our app)
- Calculating expanses (because AWS never makes things easy)
- Q/A

We will be going over lot of things and concept, but I'll explain what everything does and more importantly why we are doing it this way.

Main goal is to walk away with a bit less fear of clouds and bit more courage to deploy things.
