full_description:

Join us for an in-depth exploration of our "Machine Learning Development Pipeline (MLDevPipeline)," a cutting-edge MLOps solution. We will unveil the seamless integration of Python and advanced tools, showcasing how our MLDevPipeline enables a continuous machine learning development process. Our MLDevPipeline was developed alongside our model development which is focusing on generative behavior modeling for realistic traffic agents. These agents play an integral part in the simulation of traffic scenarios to enable continuous development and safe deployment of autonomous vehicles. Beyond that project the MLDevPipeline has proven its effectiveness as an inner-source project. 

The talk addresses the critical need for a streamlined and efficient MLOps solution, tackling the challenges of managing complex machine learning workflows, including data preprocessing, hyperparameter optimization, and model deployment. We will also share insights gained from our project, highlighting the innovative approaches and best practices that have emerged during the development of our MLDevPipeline. By presenting our solution, we aim to provide the audience with practical insights and strategies to enhance their own ML workflows and address similar challenges in their projects. 

Our MLDevPipeline leverages a suite of Python packages and non-Python tools, including PyTorch, PyTorch Lightning for streamlined data preprocessing, model training and evaluation, Hydra for configuration management and hyperparameter optimization, MLflow with a self-developed buffered logger for seamless and comprehensive model analysis, and Docker for efficient model deployment. Additionally, we utilize Docker for a containerized pipeline in GitHub Actions and on a high-performance training cluster, enhancing the efficiency and scalability of our ML workflows. We use GitHub Actions as a powerful CI/CD orchestrator and make use of the latest action features for AI-supported code reviews and pull request monitoring. 

One example and key feature is the automatic retraining and evaluation on every merged pull request to the main branch, essential for continuously monitoring model performance. This feature includes remote job submission on a high-performance training cluster, automated issue-opening for failed retrainings, a fully containerized pipeline using Apptainer and Docker, and ML lifecycle management based on MLflow. Another insightful example is our hyperparameter optimization based on Hydra as well as our automated model deployment and API-based interfacing with the customer application.  

Attendees will gain practical insights and best practices for orchestrating a successful ML pipeline, optimizing hyperparameters, and deploying models efficiently. They will also learn how to maintain software quality and automate documentation generation, enhancing collaboration and understanding within their development teams.
