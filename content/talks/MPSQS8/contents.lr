abstract: Join us for an insightful exploration of our "Machine Learning Development Pipeline (MLDevPipeline)," an innovative MLOps solution designed to streamline the continuous development of machine learning models. Developed in conjunction with our generative behavior modeling project for realistic traffic agents, our MLDevPipeline plays a crucial role in simulating traffic scenarios, facilitating the safe deployment of autonomous vehicles. This presentation addresses the pressing need for efficient MLOps solutions to manage complex workflows, including data preprocessing, hyperparameter optimization, and model deployment. 

We will share valuable insights and best practices derived from our project, showcasing the integration of Python packages and non-Python tools such as PyTorch, Hydra, and MLflow, alongside Docker for containerization and CI/CD orchestration via GitHub Actions. A key feature of our pipeline is the automatic retraining and evaluation triggered by merged pull requests, ensuring continuous model performance monitoring. Attendees will learn about our hyperparameter optimization strategies, automated model deployment, and API interfacing with customer applications. 

By participating, attendees will gain practical insights into orchestrating successful ML pipelines, optimizing hyperparameters, deploying models efficiently, and enhancing collaboration in the team. Join us to discover how to elevate your ML workflows and tackle similar challenges in your projects.
