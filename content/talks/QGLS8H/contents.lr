abstract: Two truths and a lie:

You have been hacked and you don’t know yet
You haven’t been hacked because it’s not yet convenient (for the attackers)
You think your application is secure

Join this talk if you are interested in understanding a bit more about modern security and how it goes way beyond the code of your app.
