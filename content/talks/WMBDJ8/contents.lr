abstract: When I was hired as a Scientist for Machine Learning, experts said ML would never work in weather forecasting. Nowadays, I get to contribute to Anemoi, a full-featured ML weather forecasting framework used by international weather agencies to research, build, and scale AI weather forecasting models. 

The project started out as a curiosity by my colleagues and soon scaled as a result of its initial success. As machine learning stories go, this is a story of change, adaptation and making things work. 

In this talk, I'll share some practical lessons: how we evolved from a mono-package with four people working on it to multiple open-source packages with 40+ internal and external collaborators. Specifically, how we managed the explosion of over 300 config options without losing all of our sanity, building a separation of packages that works for both researchers and operations teams, as well as CI/CD and testing that constrains how many bugs we can introduce in a given day. You'll learn concrete patterns for growing Python packaging for ML systems, and balancing research flexibility with production stability. As a bonus, I'll sprinkle in anecdotes where LLMs like chatGPT and Copilot massively failed at facilitating this evolution.

Join me for a deep dive into the real challenges of scaling ML systems - where the weather may be hard to predict, but our code doesn't have to be.
