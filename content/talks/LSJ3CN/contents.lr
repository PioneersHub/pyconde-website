abstract:

While The Cloud is just someone elses computer, those computers come together from many places and many, many someone elses. The constituent parts to connect, power, house, and ultimately operate those computers are from many more places and someones still! We explore what these infrastructure pieces of The Cloud are explicitly; and how the many definitions of digital sovereignty can be viewed from the viewpoint high up in The Cloud.
