abstract:

Python is a powerful and versatile programming language, but its performance can sometimes fall short for computationally intensive tasks. Numba, a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler, bridges this gap by enabling Python developers to achieve near-C-level performance without leaving the Python ecosystem. In this talk, we will introduce Numba, explore its capabilities for accelerating numerical computations, and demonstrate how it integrates seamlessly with popular libraries like NumPy. Attendees will learn how to optimize Python code for speed using simple annotations and techniques, making it accessible even for those new to performance optimization. Whether you're a data scientist, machine learning engineer, or developer working with large datasets or simulations, this session will empower you to unlock the full potential of Python for high-performance computing.

### Python's Simplicity vs. Performance Bottlenecks

Python's simplicity makes it the go-to language for data science and machine learning, but its interpreted nature creates significant performance bottlenecks in numerical computations. This talk addresses the critical challenge faced by ML engineers and data scientists: **how to maintain Python's ease of use while achieving C-like performance for computation-heavy tasks**. Through practical examples from real-world ML pipelines, we'll explore how Numba can transform slow Python code into high-performance implementations without sacrificing readability or requiring low-level programming expertise.
