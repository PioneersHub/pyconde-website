abstract: Python is a powerful and versatile programming language, but its performance can sometimes fall short for computationally intensive tasks. Numba, a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler, bridges this gap by enabling Python developers to achieve near-C-level performance without leaving the Python ecosystem. In this talk, we will introduce Numba, explore its capabilities for accelerating numerical computations, and demonstrate how it integrates seamlessly with popular libraries like NumPy. Attendees will learn how to optimize Python code for speed using simple annotations and techniques, making it accessible even for those new to performance optimization. Whether you're a data scientist, machine learning engineer, or developer working with large datasets or simulations, this session will empower you to unlock the full potential of Python for high-performance computing.
