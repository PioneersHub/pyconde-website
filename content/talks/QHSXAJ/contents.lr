abstract:

Discover the options we have to observe with OpenTelemetry our Python applications running inside a Kubernetes cluster (or not) without touching the application code. We'll evaluate the differences between the two solutions highlighting their strong and weak spots.

full_description:

In this talk we'll see the options we have to add observability to Python applications with OpenTelemetry without touching our application code. In OpenTelemetry this is called autoinstrumentation or zero-code instrumentation.
We'll see:
- The OpenTelemetry operator, a Kubernetes operator to manage collection and inject autoinstrumentation to the pods
- OpenTelemetry Python own autoinstrumentation solution based on the opentelemetry-instrument wrapper

We'll evaluate the differences between the two solutions highlighting their strong and weak spots.

We are also taking a look on the work done inside the OpenTelemetry project around GenAI.
