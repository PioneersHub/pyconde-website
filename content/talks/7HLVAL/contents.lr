abstract: The concept of "AI agents" has entered public imagination and commands industry attention, but what exactly is an AI agent? The definition is unclear, the hype going strong, and the boundaries between agents and other types AI systems - like chatbots - fuzzy. 

This talk critically examines the concept of AI agents: What makes an agent an agent? Is it tool use, a long planning horizon, a certain degree of autonomy, or something else entirely? We’ll explore the history of AI agents, dissect their characteristics, and contrast marketing language with the reality of the current technological state of the art. Finally, we’ll discuss practical use cases for AI agents and when alternative AI approaches might be more appropriate.
