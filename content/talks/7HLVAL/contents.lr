abstract:

The concept of "AI agents" has entered public imagination and commands industry attention, but what exactly is an AI agent? The definition is unclear, the hype going strong, and the boundaries between agents and other types AI systems - like chatbots - fuzzy. 

This talk critically examines the concept of AI agents: What makes an agent an agent? Is it tool use, a long planning horizon, a certain degree of autonomy, or something else entirely? We’ll explore the history of AI agents, dissect their characteristics, and contrast marketing language with the reality of the current technological state of the art. Finally, we’ll discuss practical use cases for AI agents and when alternative AI approaches might be more appropriate.

full_description:

The term "AI agent" is thrown around liberally in current AI-related discourse, often with varying definitions and an overwhelming dose of hype. But what does it actually mean? This talk seeks to clarify the concept of agentic AI through four angles:

1. **What are AI Agents?**: We’ll dive deep into what makes an AI system an "agent." Is it its ability to autonomously plan, adapt, or use external tools? How does it differ from a sophisticated, tool-using chatbot? By analyzing different frameworks and definitions, we’ll aim to distill the the essential properties of agentic systems.
    1. **Technology vs. Interface**: A critical distinction exists between the underlying technology of AI agents and the interfaces through which users interact with them. We’ll explore how user-facing designs shape the perception of an AI system as an agent and whether this distinction helps clarify or muddy the definition.
2. **Why now?, or: beware the snake oil**: The pace of progress in AI is nothing short of dramatic, but that doesn’t mean that every new development will be as groundbreaking as advertised. We take a bird’s eye view of the current development trends in AI and discuss why agents are such a popular concept now. We analyze the marketing lingo by contextualizing who’s pushing for agents right now and they stand to gain from it.
3. **Applications and Use Cases**: Not every problem calls for an AI agent. We’ll evaluate scenarios where agent-based systems excel, such as multi-step task automation, and others where simpler or alternative AI solutions are more effective.

Throughout the talk, we’ll also take a brief look at the historical evolution of the concept of AI agents, from early academic definitions to today’s commercial implementations.

By critically analyzing the concept and separating hype from substance, this talk aims to provide clarity, foster a deeper understanding, and help participants make informed decisions about when—and when not—to deploy AI agents.

## Takeaways

Attendees will leave with:

1. A clearer understanding of what defines an AI agent and how it differs from other AI systems like chatbots, as well as insights into the relationship between an AI agent’s technological backbone and its user-facing interface.
2. Insights into the current state of AI model development, the reasons behind the rising prominence of AI agents, and how much of the hype can be attributed to marketing strategies and venture capital interests rather than genuine technological advancements.
3. Practical guidance on when to use AI agents and when alternative approaches might be more suitable.

This talk will enable participants to critically assess the concept of AI agents, navigate the hype, and make better-informed strategic decisions in their AI development and deployment.
