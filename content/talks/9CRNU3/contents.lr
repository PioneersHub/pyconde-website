abstract:

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful technique for searching across unstructured documents, but it often falls short when the task demands an understanding of intricate relationships between entities. GraphRAG addresses this by leveraging knowledge graphs to capture these relationships, but it struggles with scalability and handling diverse unstructured formats. In this talk, we’ll explore how HybridRAG combines the strengths of both approaches - RAG for scalable unstructured data retrieval and GraphRAG for semantic richness- to deliver accurate and contextually relevant answers. We’ll dive into its application, challenges, and the significant improvements it offers for question-answering systems across various domains.

#### Outline:

1. Introduction  
   - The challenge of extracting information from unstructured and domain-specific text (e.g., legal documents).  
   - Overview of traditional RAG techniques and their limitations:  
     - Scalability and unstructured data handling.  
     - Lack of semantic depth to capture intricate relationships.  
   - Why HybridRAG is a game-changer.  

2. What is RAG? 
   - Explanation of vector-based retrieval using embeddings and databases.  
   - Advantages of RAG:  
     - Scalable search across diverse unstructured formats.  
     - Domain-agnostic retrieval capabilities.  
   - Limitations:  
     - Inability to capture relationships between entities.  
     - Difficulty handling domain-specific or complex queries.  

3. What is GraphRAG?  
   - Explanation of GraphRAG: How knowledge graphs enhance retrieval by mapping relationships between entities.  
   - Benefits of GraphRAG:  
     - Semantic richness and contextual understanding.  
     - Effective for domains requiring deep relational reasoning (e.g., finance, healthcare).  
   - Challenges of GraphRAG:  
     - Building high-quality knowledge graphs from unstructured data.  
     - Scalability and integration with generative models.  

4. Introducing HybridRAG: Combining RAG and GraphRAG 
   - The HybridRAG architecture:  
     - RAG for scalable retrieval of unstructured data.

     - Improved retrieval accuracy and contextual relevance.  
   - Use case: Legal documents processing (e.g., extracting Q&A insights).  
     - How RAG retrieves general context.  
     - How GraphRAG captures relationships (e.g., between companies, documents, events).  

5. Challenges in Building HybridRAG Systems
   - Creating high-quality knowledge graphs from diverse and unstructured data.  
   - Balancing computational overhead from combining RAG and GraphRAG.  
   - Addressing domain-specific terminology and ensuring generalizability to other domains.
