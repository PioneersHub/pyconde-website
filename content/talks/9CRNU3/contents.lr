abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful technique for searching across unstructured documents, but it often falls short when the task demands an understanding of intricate relationships between entities. GraphRAG addresses this by leveraging knowledge graphs to capture these relationships, but it struggles with scalability and handling diverse unstructured formats. In this talk, we’ll explore how HybridRAG combines the strengths of both approaches - RAG for scalable unstructured data retrieval and GraphRAG for semantic richness- to deliver accurate and contextually relevant answers. We’ll dive into its application, challenges, and the significant improvements it offers for question-answering systems across various domains.
