abstract: Time series forecasting in the retail industry is uniquely challenging: Datasets often include stockouts that censor actual demand, promotional events cause irregular demand spikes, new product launches face cold-start issues, and diverse demand patterns within an imbalanced product portfolio create modeling challenges.
In this talk, we’ll explore proven, real-world strategies and examples to address these problems. Learn how to successfully handle censored demand caused by stockouts, effectively incorporate promotional effects, and tackle the variability of diverse products using clustering and ensembling strategies. Whether you’re a seasoned data scientist or a Python developer exploring forecasting, the goal of this session is to introduce you to the key challenges in retail forecasting and equip you with actionable insights to successfully overcome them in real-life scenarios.
