abstract: PyPLUTO is a versatile Python package designed for loading, analyzing, and visualizing data from simulations produced by the astrophysical code PLUTO. By integrating libraries like NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib, PyPLUTO facilitates the visualization of numerical outputs, showcasing how Python effectively enhances scientific understanding and communication.

description: Numerical simulations have become essential for tackling complex astrophysical problems in recent years. The MagnetoHydroDynamics (MHD) framework plays a central role in studying the dynamic evolution of astrophysical plasmas, governed by partial differential equations that conserve mass, momentum, and energy while incorporating Maxwell's equations for electromagnetic field evolution. Due to the high nonlinearity of the MHD equations (regardless of their specifications, e.g., classical/relativistic or ideal/resistive), a general analytical solution is precluded, making the numerical approach crucial. Numerical simulations usually end up producing large sets of data files and their scientific analysis leans on dedicated software designed for data visualization. However, in order to encompass all of the code output features, specialized tools focusing on the numerical code may represent a more versatile and built-in tool. Here, we present PyPLUTO, a Python package tailored for efficient loading, manipulation, and visualization of outputs produced with the PLUTO code. PyPLUTO uses memory mapping to optimize data loading and provides general routines for data manipulation and visualization. Additionally, it supports the particle modules of the PLUTO code, enabling visualization of particles such as cosmic rays, Lagrangian particles, or dust in hybrid simulations. A user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) further enhances accessibility, allowing for the creation of single-subplot figures with ease. PyPLUTO provides a comprehensive, versatile toolkit for astrophysical data exploration and interpretation.
