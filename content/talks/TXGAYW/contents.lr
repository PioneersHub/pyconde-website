abstract: How do we detect complex ideas like attitudes toward science or politics in large amounts of text? Traditional methods struggle with abstract concepts, but domain-aware contextual representations make this possible. This innovative approach uncovers hidden patterns in how ideas are framed, whether in speeches, articles, or social media. By analyzing text using an advanced LLM-driven, domain-informed approach, we can reveal new insights into topics that are hard to measure. Itâ€™s a powerful tool for unlocking meaning in unstructured data.
