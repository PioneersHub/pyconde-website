abstract:

While generative AI and large language models (LLMs) promise significant productivity gains, fewer than 10% of companies use them in production, citing unclear ROI and security concerns. This talk explores key adoption barriers and highlights the security risks of LLMs, including prompt injection, data poisoning, and sensitive information disclosure. By addressing these challenges and mitigation strategies, we aim to provide actionable insights for adopting generative AI securely and effectively.

full_description:

Generative AI and large language models (LLMs) are reshaping industries, offering potential productivity gains of up to 30%. Yet, fewer than 10% of companies have successfully deployed these technologies in production. Why the gap? This session explores the multifaceted challenges of transitioning generative AI from innovation to implementation, focusing on both the technical and organizational barriers that hinder widespread adoption.

Key challenges, including:

- Security risks such as prompt injection, data poisoning, and sensitive information disclosure, which can compromise systems and erode trust.
- Technical limitations of LLMs, including hallucinations, scalability issues, and the need for interpretability and reliable output in high-stakes applications.
- Organizational hurdles, such as unclear ROI, lack of technical expertise, and concerns over integrating AI into existing workflows.
This talk will also shed light on the broader limitations of generative AI, including its reliance on high-quality data, computational cost, and the ongoing challenges of aligning AI-generated content with business goals.

Attendees will leave with:

A comprehensive understanding of the primary barriers to deploying generative AI in production.
Insights into the present limitations of LLMs and how they impact real-world use cases.
Practical, actionable strategies for overcoming these challenges, from enhancing security frameworks to building internal capabilities and realistic adoption roadmaps.
