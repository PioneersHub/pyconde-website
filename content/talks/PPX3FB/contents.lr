abstract: While generative AI and large language models (LLMs) promise significant productivity gains, fewer than 10% of companies use them in production, citing unclear ROI and security concerns. This talk explores key adoption barriers and highlights the security risks of LLMs, including prompt injection, data poisoning, and sensitive information disclosure. By addressing these challenges and mitigation strategies, we aim to provide actionable insights for adopting generative AI securely and effectively.
