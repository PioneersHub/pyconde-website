### **Detailed Description**  
This tutorial introduces **Agentic AI**—a design approach where multiple agents collaborate to solve complex tasks efficiently. Using the **CrewAI Python library**, we’ll start with the fundamentals and progressively move towards advanced concepts, focusing on practical implementation.

#### **What We’ll Cover:**  
1. **Understanding Agentic AI:** Core principles and why multi-agent systems are valuable.  
2. **Getting Started with CrewAI:** Setting up the library and creating simple agents.  
3. **Advanced Agent Interactions:** Defining workflows, collaboration patterns, and communication protocols.  
4. **Building from Scratch:** Step-by-step guide to developing a complete multi-agent application.  
5. **Implementing Guardrails:** Techniques to ensure agents operate within defined constraints.  
6. **Preventing Query Injection:** Strategies for securing agent queries against malicious inputs.  

#### **Why Attend?**  
By the end of this session, you’ll have hands-on experience building an agent-based application, understand how to implement security measures, and be equipped with best practices for maintaining control over agent behavior. Whether you're new to agentic systems or looking to refine your skills, this tutorial will provide both the theory and the practical insights needed to start building with CrewAI.  

**Prerequisites:** Familiarity with Python and basic AI concepts will help you get the most out of this session.
