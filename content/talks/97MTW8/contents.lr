abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) combines the power of real-time data retrieval with large language model (LLM) capabilities, enabling accurate, up-to-date, and contextually relevant outputs. By querying external databases or documents during text generation, RAG addresses key challenges like hallucinations and enhances fact-based responses. However, the dynamic nature of user behavior, query patterns, and system updates makes monitoring data drift essential to ensure RAG applications' long-term reliability and performance.

Monitoring data drift in RAG applications is crucial to maintaining their reliability and performance over time. In this tutorial, we explore the drifts that can affect RAG systems and discuss their impact on performance. We will further explore how to monitor LLM drift using Evidently, an open-source tool designed for monitoring machine learning models. The session will include a live demonstration of Evidently’s Reports, Test Suites, and Monitoring Dashboard. Attendees will gain practical insights into maintaining the efficacy of RAG applications in the face of evolving data distributions, user behavior, and system updates.
