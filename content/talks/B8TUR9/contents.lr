abstract: As a data scientist, I value the power of insightful visualizations to unlock unique interpretations of complex data. In my talk, I will introduce an elegant mathematical framework called Formal Concept Analysis (FCA), developed in the 1980s in Darmstadt.

FCA transforms binary data into concepts that can be visualized as a hierarchical graph, offering a fresh perspective on multidimensional data analysis. Leveraging this theory and its open-source Python libraries, I am developing an interactive Dash-based tool featuring interactive tables and graphs to explore data insights.

To illustrate its potential, I will showcase an optimization of the entire tariffing system of an energy provider company, highlighting how FCA can bring structure and clarity to even such tangled datasets.

description: My goal is to introduce Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) as a fascinating mathematical framework. I aim to inspire Python enthusiasts to explore its potential and uncover insights in their data analysis tasks. The talk is divided into three sections:

1 FCA Basics

- What is a "concept"? *First, I am going to introduce the main terms used in FCA and define the central object of the theory - the formal concept.*

- Illustrative example. *To show the power of FCA in action, I will provide a relatable example to explain the hierarchical structure of the graph visualization.*

2 Python Implementation

- ``fcapy`` Python library. *Core functionality overview of the library and the data formats it can use.*

- Introducing interactivity with Python Dash: *Enhancing exploration and user experience with interactive tables (AG Grid) and dynamic graph visualizations (Cytoscape).*

3 Applications and Practical Relevance 

- Use Case: Energy Tariffing System Optimization. *In this section, I am going to showcase the real data in its original complexity and the optimization process of identifying redundancies, overlaps, or inefficiencies.*
- Examples of other  applications and key takeaways
