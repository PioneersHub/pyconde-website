abstract: Frameworks like `llama-stack` and `langchain` allow for quick prototyping of generative AI applications. However, companies often struggle to deploy these applications into production quickly. This talk explores the design of a Python SDK that enables the development of AI skills in Python and their compilation into WebAssembly (WASM) components, targeting a specific host runtime that offers interfaces for interacting with LLMs and associated tooling.
