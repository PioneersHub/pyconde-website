abstract: As a developer, you play a crucial role in the security of your projects. At the same time, security is but one of the many responsibilities a developer has to fulfill these days. It almost seems like you must be an expert in just about anything!

Thankfully, you don't have to be a security expert to contribute to the security of your projects. In this talk, I will show you how to approach security systematically without feeling overwhelmed.

First, I will discuss some background on security theory and my take on the role of developers in security. This discussion will include the difficult topic of advocating for security with product owners and stakeholders. Then, I will introduce you to open-source industry standards, such as the [OWASP DevSecOps Maturity Model](https://owasp.org/www-project-devsecops-maturity-model/), that you can use to start implementing security in your projects.

By the end of my talk, you will not be a security expert, but you should have enough pointers to get started with security!
