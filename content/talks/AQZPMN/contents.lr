abstract:

As a developer, you play a crucial role in the security of your projects. At the same time, security is but one of the many responsibilities a developer has to fulfill these days. It almost seems like you must be an expert in just about anything!

Thankfully, you don't have to be a security expert to contribute to the security of your projects. In this talk, I will show you how to approach security systematically without feeling overwhelmed.

First, I will discuss some background on security theory and my take on the role of developers in security. This discussion will include the difficult topic of advocating for security with product owners and stakeholders. Then, I will introduce you to open-source industry standards, such as the [OWASP DevSecOps Maturity Model](https://owasp.org/www-project-devsecops-maturity-model/), that you can use to start implementing security in your projects.

By the end of my talk, you will not be a security expert, but you should have enough pointers to get started with security!

full_description:

If you've been a developer somewhere in the past two decades, you've probably noticed the push for shifting security "left" in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). While this doesn't mean that security wasn't a concern for developers before, there is an increasing emphasis on security earlier in the development process.

On paper, this sounds great, but security isn't the only responsibility that has been added to or increased in emphasis on the developer's plate. We cannot shift left _everything_ and expect developers to become experts in _everything_. That just isn't scalable.

That is why I will start my talk by discussing the role of developers in security. I will talk about security culture, the shift-left movement, the responsibilities of software developers, and how you can manage them without being overwhelmed.

I will not ignore the difficult topic that haunts us all: How do you advocate for security as a developer? While many organizations shout about their security ambitions, most product owners and stakeholders still need convincing that good security takes time.

While doing so, I will also introduce some core security concepts and frameworks to help you think about security. While many of us are familiar with individual components such as security scanners and secure coding patterns to avoid common vulnerabilities, the bigger picture you get from zooming out helps you determine which security practices you should prioritize in your project.

In the second part of my talk, I will turn to the more practical side of security: How do you get started with security?

Luckily, we can rely on the expertise of others in this area: We can turn to open-source industry standards for guidance. Specifically, I will introduce you to the [OWASP DevSecOps Maturity Model](https://owasp.org/www-project-devsecops-maturity-model/). This model is especially accessible to developers and gives you concrete practices to implement in your workflow.

By the end of this talk, you should have the guidance you need to get started with security!
