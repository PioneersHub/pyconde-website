abstract: In this session, weâ€™ll explore the three leading modern data lake storage formats: Delta Lake, Apache Iceberg, and Apache Hudi. Each of these formats brings unique capabilities to address the limitations of traditional data lakes. This talk will dive into their key features, compare their strengths, and provide practical guidance on when to choose each format based on specific data engineering needs like real-time processing, batch pipelines, or large-scale analytics.
