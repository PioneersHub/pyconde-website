abstract:

In today's world, where disability affects a significant percentage of the population, it is crucial for open-source communities to address the challenges faced by persons with disabilities (PWDs) and work towards their inclusion. This talk will delve into practical measures such as referral programs, internal disability disclosures, and integrating disability into existing agendas rather than treating it as a separate issue. We will dive into disability mainstreaming with a focus on its role in promoting universal design and inclusivity. Attendees will gain insights into establishing disability mainstreaming committees, formulating action plans, implementing best practices, and monitoring and evaluating progress.

Persons with Disabilities face challenges that often go unnoticed in our Open Source Communities.This talk explores the challenges faced by persons with disabilities (PWDs) and presents effective strategies to foster disability inclusion within open-source communities. Globally, disability affects a significant portion of the population, resulting in high levels of unemployment and low community participation of PWDs. PWDs often find themselves limited to low-paying entry-level jobs, perpetuating inequality and poverty. Women with disabilities and individuals with intellectual disabilities, or multiple disabilities face even greater employment disparities. By giving them a chance as Open Source Communities we will be opening them up to several opportunities.

The talk will present a range of effective strategies, initiatives, and action plans to foster disability inclusion within open-source communities. It will discuss the importance of transformational leadership that questions existing systems, paradigms, and assumptions to drive change. Additionally, creating a compelling vision for social change will be explored, emphasizing the need to address social inequalities in Open Source Communities.

We will delve into practical measures and solutions to this, listed below:
- How to set-up disability inclusion committees in our open source communities, who should be a member and how to sustain them
- Coming up with internal referral programs and a streamlined disability disclosure system within the community.
- Drafting a Disability Mainstreaming Action plan, its contents and how to customize it to suit your community
- Effectively using quarterly reports to show progress on specified Disability Mainstreaming Indicators.

By the end of the talk, attendees will leave with actionable strategies to foster disability inclusion within their open-source communities. The aim is to create an environment that is more inclusive, welcoming, and empowering for persons with disabilities, ultimately enriching the open-source movement as a whole.
