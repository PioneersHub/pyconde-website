abstract: We will explore how to add data versioning to an ML project; a simple end-to-end rain prediction project for the Munich area. The data assets will be stored in an OSS repository built for data projects, and we will use its lakeFS-spec Python package for easy interaction with other Python libraries. Following model training with initial data, we will update the dataset and retrain the model. Finally, we will revert to the initial data version to reproduce the original model and assess its initial accuracy.
