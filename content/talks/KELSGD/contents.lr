abstract:

The CICDDoS2019 dataset is the latest and rich source of labeled data that represents diverse types of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. It serves as a valuable resource for understanding network anomalies, particularly in modern networks like Software-Defined Networks (SDN). This talk focuses on feature analysis, including exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, feature engineering, and dimensionality reduction techniques, applied to dissect the dataset’s attack types, such as DNS, MSSQL, NTP, and UDP flooding. Using Python’s powerful data-handling libraries, we demonstrate how clustering with K-Means and advanced EDA techniques can reveal key patterns in network traffic. Attendees will gain actionable insights into processing large-scale datasets, extracting critical features, and implementing effective feature engineering practices for anomaly detection and classification.

full_description:

Understanding the unique characteristics of various DDoS attack types is crucial for developing robust detection and mitigation strategies. The CICDDoS2019 dataset provides an extensive collection of labeled data across different attack types, such as DNS, MSSQL, LDAP, and Syn flooding, among others. This session delves into feature analysis and engineering methodologies that transform raw traffic data into meaningful insights for anomaly detection.
