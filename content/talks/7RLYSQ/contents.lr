abstract:

Explore the power of Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) for GenAI agents! Learn how to build AI systems that augment your abilities, not replace your judgment, especially when high-stakes actions are involved. This session will focus on practical implementation using Python and Langchain to stay in control.

full_description:

Imagine a world where AI agents handle complex tasks on your behalf – managing your finances, optimizing energy consumption in your home, or even coordinating logistics for a global supply chain. The potential benefits are enormous, but what happens when these agents need to perform critical actions?

Most of us would probably prefer to have a say in those decisions. We want AI to augment our abilities, not replace our judgment, especially when high-stakes actions are involved. In this session we explore how to add a Human in the Loop (HITL) capabilities to your GenAI agents using Python and Langhain.
