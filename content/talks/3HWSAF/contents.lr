abstract:

Let's embark on a short journey through more than 3 decades of Computer Vision.

Starting from LeNet, we will mingle with Viola & Jones, before moving on to Convolutional Neural Networks and Vision Transformers. Which architecture is better? Let's find out together! 

Last but not least we will look at Vision-Language Models and their amazing capabilities. All this is topped by a look into our crystal ball, to see where the journey might take us.

By the end of this talk, you'll have a deeper understanding of the key developments that have shaped the field of Computer Vision. You'll also gain a sense of the exciting possibilities that lie ahead, and how we can all contribute to the next chapter in the story of Computer Vision.

The presentation is suited for all skill levels, you don't need any specific Machine Learning or Computer Vision knowledge (although it might help to get some jokes).

full_description:

Have you ever heard of the Neocognitron, the Swarovski AX Visio, Capsule Networks or the only alpine parrot of the world?

Join our little trip trough time, to make sure you can answer to all the above (and more) with a certain YES!

We will look at the roots of today's powerful CV models, discover the "Big Bang" of modern Deep Learning and have a look what the future holds.
