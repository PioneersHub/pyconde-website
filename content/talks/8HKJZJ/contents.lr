abstract:

Most organizations leverage dashboards to monitor data, processes, or business metrics. However, commercial solutions often fall short due to licensing costs, lack of customization, or limited integration options. In contrast, open-source solutions offer unmatched flexibility and transparency. This presentation will explore the advantages of using open-source dashboards from both the business manager's and developer's perspectives.

We’ll reflect on five years of lessons learned, revisiting core challenges faced during the development of custom dashboards. Using GLEIF’s publicly accessible Data Quality Dashboard as an example, we'll discuss how to choose the right open-source tools while balancing business needs and technical feasibility. At the core, the Dashboard builds on popular Python libraries, like FastAPI, Celery, and SQLAlchemy. Attendees will gain insights into avoiding common pitfalls and learn strategies for integrating open-source tools into business use cases.

This talk will provide a unique dual perspective, offering actionable insights for both developers and business stakeholders. It aims to foster a richer understanding of how Python tools can deliver superior outcomes when business goals and technical strategies align.

full_description:

We begin with an introduction to the problem from a service owner perspective, highlighting the high cost, limited customizability, and transparency issues of commercial dashboards, while emphasizing the flexibility and control that open-source solutions offer. Next, we discuss choosing a web framework, focusing on the reasons why FastAPI is ideal for our development and business needs while comparing it to alternatives such as Flask and Django.

We then discuss data source integration, detailing the challenges developers face with ORMs such as SQLAlchemy and highlighting the business requirements for long-term data integrity. This is followed by an exploration of performance management, where we explain how task queues optimize compute-intensive tasks and ensure smooth user experiences that are critical for real-time decision-making.

Finally, we summarise the development of a fully functional open-source dashboard tailored to both business and technical requirements, setting the stage for a dynamic discussion. The session concludes with a Q&A session that encourages participants to share their insights and explore best practices for building custom open-source dashboard solutions.
