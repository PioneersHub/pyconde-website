abstract: In the data science field, we use all these powerful methods to solve important problems. Most of the time, we do this very well because our data science and machine-learning toolbox fits the problems we tackle quite precisely. Yet, what about our everyday choices or even our most important life decisions? Can we use for our private lives what we advocate for in our jobs or are these choices inherently different?
Many of this real life decisions are a little different than textbook machine-learning problems. There is often less or hard-to-come-by data and the decisions are infrequent, but sometimes very consequential. This talk will dive into what makes everyday decisions difficult to handle with our data science toolbox. It will show how Bayesian thinking can help to reason in such cases, especially when there is not a lot of data to rely on.
