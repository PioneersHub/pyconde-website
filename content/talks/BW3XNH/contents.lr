abstract: Our eyes are our windows to the world. Through them we recognize familiar faces, read books that make us giggle, or even walk to our favourite coffee shop. With Python, you can allow robots to see the world just like you do! By giving them this ability, they become smarter and more interactive.

In this talk, I’ll discuss how to achieve this using Python and OpenCV. You’ll learn the basics of processing images, detecting objects and making your robot respond to its environment. We’ll also cover how to integrate this in your robot or simulate this in Gazebo.

By the end, you’ll know how to give your robot the ability to see and respond to the world, _just like you do!_
