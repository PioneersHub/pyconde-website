full_description:

Although DevSecOps has been a trend topic for years, it is still far from being a solved problem.

This interactive session brings the challenges of security in the development process to life: Participants are confronted with several scenarios from everyday project work and their decisions help shape the further course of the presentation. They have to reconcile security requirements with budget, development speed and user-friendliness and bring the project safely from the idea to live operation.

The session covers the entire development process, but each run is different as the audience decides the course of the story via online-voting: How to proceed with the development project and think about security at the same time?
