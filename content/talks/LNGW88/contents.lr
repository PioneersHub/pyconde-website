abstract: [Polars](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars) uses [expressions](https://docs.pola.rs/user-guide/concepts/expressions-and-contexts/#expressions) to provide the user with a flexible and modular API to create queries.

Polars expressions are lazy representations of data manipulations and it's only within a Polars context that these expressions materialise into concrete results.
In turn, [expression expansion](https://docs.pola.rs/user-guide/concepts/expressions-and-contexts/#expression-expansion) is an underused Polars feature that lets you write a single expression and apply it to multiple columns, making it a very convenient feature that is loved by all Polars users.
