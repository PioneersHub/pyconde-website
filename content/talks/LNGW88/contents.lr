abstract: [Polars](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars) uses [expressions](https://docs.pola.rs/user-guide/concepts/expressions-and-contexts/#expressions) to provide the user with a flexible and modular API to create queries.

Polars expressions are lazy representations of data manipulations and it's only within a Polars context that these expressions materialise into concrete results.
In turn, [expression expansion](https://docs.pola.rs/user-guide/concepts/expressions-and-contexts/#expression-expansion) is an underused Polars feature that lets you write a single expression and apply it to multiple columns, making it a very convenient feature that is loved by all Polars users.

description: This talk will start by explaining what it really means for expressions to be lazy representations of data manipulations and within that context we give a motivating example that explains why we need expression expansion.

Then, we explore all of the ways in which expression expansion can be used, namely in column selection and within structs, and we explore the different patterns and types of selections that can be used within expression expansion.

Finally, we conclude with some miscellaneous tips on how to make the best use of expression expansion and show a real world example of a data query that was greatly simplified and sped up by the introduction of expression expansion.
