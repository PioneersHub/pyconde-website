abstract: The deployment of AI projects often faces significant hurdles due to the fragmented nature of their components—datasets, models, and model weights are frequently stored in separate repositories, formats, or locations.

In this talk, we will explore the critical challenges posed by these disjointed workflows. We will discuss how we can addresses these issues by introducing an open source universal, open-source packaging and versioning solution based on the Open Container Initiative (OCI) standard to package together all of AI components in a single image by sharing production examples of open source projects like KitOps which are focused on making AI packaging more streamlined. This enables seamless integration of AI/ML components into cloud-native infrastructures, ensuring secure, auditable, and efficient deployment.

Thus attendees will discover practical strategies for standardizing AI/ML packaging with a practical example of turning Jupyter notebook into deployable artifacts. 

The talk will dive into the limitations of Jupyter Notebooks in production environments and introduce a step-by-step process to overcome these hurdles. Using a real-world example of fine-tuning a LLama3 LLM model, we'll demonstrate how to leverage tools like KitOps and ModelKit to create immutable, secure, and shareable artifacts for Jupyter notebooks

Key topics include:

- Understanding the stages of bringing an ML model to production
- Creating untuned ModelKits for dataset preparation
- Fine-tuning models and packaging adapters
- Transitioning from challenger to champion models
- Deploying models to production environments like Kubernetes
- Bringing Container-Native Simplicity to AI/ML
