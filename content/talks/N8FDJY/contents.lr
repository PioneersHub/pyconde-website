abstract: The deployment of AI projects often faces significant hurdles due to the fragmented nature of their componentsâ€”datasets, models, and model weights are frequently stored in separate repositories, formats, or locations.

In this talk, we will explore the critical challenges posed by these disjointed workflows. We will discuss how we can addresses these issues by introducing an open source universal, open-source packaging and versioning solution based on the Open Container Initiative (OCI) standard to package together all of AI components in a single image by sharing production examples of open source projects like KitOps which are focused on making AI packaging more streamlined. This enables seamless integration of AI/ML components into cloud-native infrastructures, ensuring secure, auditable, and efficient deployment.
