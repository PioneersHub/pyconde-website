abstract: EffiDict is a Python package which behaves exactly like a dictionary but uses the disk to handle larger amounts of data. Depending on the application, users can choose from various replacement strategies; we have implemented some popular cache replacement policies such as LRU and LFU. Additionally, users can select either pickle or SQLite for persistence. We have used EffiDict to enhance the performance of the Oligo Designer Toolsuite, which relies on large dictionaries for its pipelines. Switching to EffiDict allowed us to offload some parts to disk, which significantly improved the program's performance and enabled it to process much larger amounts of data.

description: EffiDict is a Python package which behaves exactly like a dictionary but uses the disk to handle larger amounts of data. This talk will cover:

- An overview of EffiDictâ€™s architecture and key features.
- A practical application to one of our packages: the Oligo Designer Toolsuite, and our integration process.
- Performance tests comparing EffiDict to alternative solutions.
- Ongoing challenges with the package
- Lessons learned and best practices for incorporating EffiDict into other research software applications.
