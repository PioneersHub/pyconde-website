abstract: EffiDict is a Python package which behaves exactly like a dictionary but uses the disk to handle larger amounts of data. Depending on the application, users can choose from various replacement strategies; we have implemented some popular cache replacement policies such as LRU and LFU. Additionally, users can select either pickle or SQLite for persistence. We have used EffiDict to enhance the performance of the Oligo Designer Toolsuite, which relies on large dictionaries for its pipelines. Switching to EffiDict allowed us to offload some parts to disk, which significantly improved the program's performance and enabled it to process much larger amounts of data.
