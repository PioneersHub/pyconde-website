abstract:

Coverage tools are essential for ensuring that your tests exercise significant parts of your Python application. But what exactly is code coverage, how do coverage tools work behind the scenes, and how can you build one yourself? This is what this talk is all about.

full_description:

Coverage tools are great, but how do they work? Python 3.12 introduced a new low-impact monitoring API through PEP 669, enabling the development of significantly faster tools, including debuggers and coverage analyzers. This talk explores how to leverage the new API to implement efficient coverage tools, what insights they provide, and how they can enhance your development workflow, allowing you a peak behind the curtain.
