abstract:

In this talk, we will explore the powerful world of ensemble learning techniques in machine learning, a method that improves predictive performance by combining multiple models. We will cover the foundations of ensemble learning, beginning with an understanding of weak and strong learners and their roles in model accuracy.

We will delve into three key ensemble techniques:

Bagging: A technique where multiple base models are trained independently and in parallel, helping to reduce variance and increase stability in predictions.
Boosting: A sequential technique that builds a strong model by combining multiple weak models, focusing on reducing bias and improving prediction accuracy.
Stacking: A method that combines multiple models to build a generalized and robust final model, leveraging the strengths of diverse learners.
Throughout the session, we will break down the mechanics of each technique, explore their strengths and weaknesses, and demonstrate how they can be applied to real-world problems to elevate predictive performance.
