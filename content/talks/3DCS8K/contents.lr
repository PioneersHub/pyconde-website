abstract:

Understanding the structure and content of data frames is crucial when working with tabular data ‚Äî a core requirement for the robust pipelines we build at QuantCo.

Libraries such as `pandera` or `patito` already exist to ease the process of defining data frame schemas and validating that data frames comply with these schemas. However, when building production-ready data pipelines, we encountered limitations of these libraries. Specifically, we were missing support for strict static type checking, validation of interdependent data frames, and graceful validation including introspection of failures.

To remedy the shortcomings of these libraries, we started building `dataframely` at the beginning of last year. Dataframely is a declarative data frame validation library with first-class support for polars data frames.

Over the last year, we have gained experience in using `dataframely` both for analytical and production code across several projects. The result was a drastic improvement of the legibility of our pipeline code and our confidence in its correctness. To enable the wider data engineering community to benefit from similar effects, we have recently open-sourced `dataframely` and are keen on introducing it in this talk.

full_description:

In this talk, we will talk about the motivation behind building `dataframely` in more detail and lead the audience through its key features. We will also touch upon our learnings in developing robust data pipelines that establish clear contracts for the design of data transformations. In our experience, this significantly improves communication among developers and comprehensibility of the entire pipeline.
