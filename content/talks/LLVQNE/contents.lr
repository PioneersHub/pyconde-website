abstract:

AI agents are becoming fundamental building blocks of modern applications, thanks to their capability of understanding context with the help of the LLMs, but with added capability to interact with systems, files. AI agents that can meaningfully interact across platforms while maintaining context aren't just for large tech companies anymore as we have a number of open source AI Agent frameworks now which developers can leverage. This beginner-friendly, hands-on tutorial shows the process of creating autonomous AI agents using the Eliza framework which is an open source Python based AI Agent framework. From learning the core concepts of Agents, to understanding how to create, deploy, and manage AI agents that can handle real-world tasks.

full_description:

We'll break down the complexities of AI agent development into understandable components. Starting with basic concepts and progressing to functional implementations, participants will learn how to create, deploy, and manage AI agents that can handle real-world tasks with the help of the Eliza AI Agent framework. Finally we will have a hands on demo
