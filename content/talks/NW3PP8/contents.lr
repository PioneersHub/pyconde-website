abstract: Learn how to manage your conda- and pip-based Python dependencies with pixi.
With its declarative approach, pixi provides a reliable way for reproducible
Python environments.
Its design is based on experiences drawn from tools such as `pip`,
`conda` and `mamba` as well as Rust's `cargo`.
