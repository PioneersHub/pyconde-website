abstract: Text-based User Interfaces (TUIs) have experienced a renaissance, offering lightweight,
highly customizable interfaces for developers and end-users alike.
`Textual`, an open source framework to build cross-platform TUI applications, combines the simplicity of terminal-based applications with the sophistication of graphical interface design.
