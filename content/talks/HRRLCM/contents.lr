abstract: Text-based User Interfaces (TUIs) have experienced a renaissance, offering lightweight,
highly customizable interfaces for developers and end-users alike.
`Textual`, an open source framework to build cross-platform TUI applications, combines the simplicity of terminal-based applications with the sophistication of graphical interface design.

description: `Textual` is an open source framework to build cross-platform TUI applications with a simple python API, which is developed by `Textualize`, also known for `rich`.

Over the last years the development of `textual` made a lot of progress and finally in Dezember 2024  v1.0.0 was released.

`Textual`'s API combines modern Python with the best of developments from the web world, for a lean app development experience. De-coupled components and an advanced testing framework ensure you can maintain your app for the long-term.

In this talk we will dive into `textual`'s features, develop a small `textual` application together and see what other developers already have build.
