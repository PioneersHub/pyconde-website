abstract:

The relationship between humans and machines, especially in the context of Artificial Intelligence (AI), is shaped by hopes, concerns, and moral questions. On the one hand, advances in AI offer great promise: it can help us solve complex problems, improve healthcare, streamline workflows, and much more. Yet, at the same time, there are legitimate concerns about the control over this technology, its potential impact on jobs and society, and ethical issues related to discrimination and the loss of human autonomy. In the talk I shall will explore and illustrate the complex tension between innovation and moral responsibility in AI research.
