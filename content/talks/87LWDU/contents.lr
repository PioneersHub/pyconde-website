Can generative AI be useful beyond chatbots? In this talk, we’ll show you how we used Generative LLMs at Malt to experiment with improving our product's user experience (the “fake it phase”). The story could end here.  However, Generative LLMs have multiple flaws when used in production, especially for non-generative use cases. So, here comes the most interesting part, you will discover the process we followed to replace them with several smaller specialized models when the business value of the feature became increasingly evident (the “make it phase”).

full_description:

There is a lot of hype around generative LLMs. However, it is hard to deny their decent zero-shot performance on some tasks. That's why they can be a good solution to build prototypes if you want to craft a smoother user experience for your product. And no, we are not talking about adding a chatbot, but new features that will simplify your users' lives.

In this talk, we will take the example of a recent project at Malt, the AI brief builder. This feature can convert a job description from a user into a structured project brief on our platform. First, we'll show you how we started with a version entirely based on a Generative LLM and all the problems we faced by doing so. Then, you will learn about the process we followed to replace more and more parts of the processing with several smaller specialized models when the business value of the feature became increasingly evident. 

Are you ready to adopt and throw away Generative LLMs to simplify your users' lives?
