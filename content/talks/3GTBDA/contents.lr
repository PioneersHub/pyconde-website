abstract: If you're already a SageMaker user or prefer to run your training jobs on SageMaker to leverage its diverse and sophisticated training compute resources but still want a specialized platform to manage your computer vision data and track your CV Ops workflow, you can integrate Picsellia into your computer vision workflows. This will allow you to run your training jobs on SageMaker while using Picsellia to seamlessly manage vision datasets and model artifacts, monitor experiments, and improve the overall efficiency of your computer vision projects.

description: Assume you're already developing a computer vision system utilizing an ML platform, such as AWS Sagemaker. You'll quickly see that it lacks dedicated functionality for effective computer vision development. SageMaker provides data scientists and machine learning engineers with significant computational resources and a robust MLOps platform. However, it is not designed for the seamless execution of computer vision dataset management, model monitoring, and evaluation. 

For instance, its data sources (S3, LFS, or most existing Datalakes) don’t provide the flexibility for direct and effective annotation, optimized management of annotation artifacts, and visual examination capabilities. Also, its evaluation capabilities are not optimized to flag vision-specific issues such as occlusion or image quality.

Data scientists or ML engineers often need to utilize various tools and platforms to effectively handle vision data (i.e., images or videos) or efficiently evaluate CV model performance. Accommodating these extra components can convolute their MLOps setup.

They need a seamless and scaleable way to mitigate the bottlenecks of managing computer vision data and efficiently evaluating their computer vision models in production when leveraging a powerful ML platform like SageMaker for running training and experiment jobs. 

This talk demonstrates the use of the specialized CVOp cloud-agnostic platform (Picsellia) with their existing ML platform like AWS SageMaker to streamline computer vision workflows efficiently without using many tools or platforms. This involves leveraging SageMaker’s robust ML capabilities and Picsellia for vision dataset management, model monitoring, and evaluation. 

By the end of this session, participants will:
- Understand the key challenges in managing computer vision workflows.
- Learn how to integrate Picsellia with AWS SageMaker to optimize CVOps processes.
- Gain hands-on knowledge on managing vision datasets and monitoring and evaluating their computer vision models.
