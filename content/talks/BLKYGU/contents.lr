abstract: In our quest to improve Python deployments, we explored Pixi, a tool designed to enhance dependency management within the Conda ecosystem. This talk recounts our experience integrating Pixi into a setup used in production. We leveraged Pixi to create lockfiles, ensuring consistent builds, and to automate deployments via CI/CD pipelines. This integration led to greater reliability and efficiency, minimizing deployment errors and allowing us to concentrate more on development. Join us as we share how Pixi transformed our deployment process and offer insights into optimizing your own workflows.
