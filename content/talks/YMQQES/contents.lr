description: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful technique for enhancing the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by providing relevant context to the prompts that are passed to them. This approach enables LLMs to produce more accurate and contextually appropriate responses, improving their overall performance across various tasks.
LangChain, a cutting-edge open-source framework for developing applications powered by language models, offers a robust platform for building RAG applications. By integrating LangChain into the development process, developers can create context-aware applications that leverage the full potential of LLMs. These applications can seamlessly connect LLMs to various sources of context, such as prompt instructions, few-shot examples, and additional content, enabling them to generate more informed and coherent responses.
With its rapid adoption and growing community support, LangChain has emerged as the leading Generative AI framework, boasting over 95k stars on GitHub. Its intuitive design and powerful features make it an ideal choice for developers looking to build advanced RAG applications that push the boundaries of what is possible with language models.
This talk will present the general architecture of a LangChain application and the various components used to implement RAG including chunking, computing and storage of embeddings, vector search and so on.
Eventually, a live demo will showcase the practical use of LangChain to build a RAG application.
