abstract: Image generation using AI has made huge progress over the last years, and many people still think that DALL-E with a text prompt is the best way to generate images. There are well-known models like Stable Diffusion and Flux, which can be used with easy-to-use frontends like A1111 or Invoke AI, but if you want to do more complex or bleeding-edge workflows, you need something else. In this talk, I want to show you ComfyUI, an open-source node-based GUI written in Python where you can build complex pipelines that are otherwise only possible using plain code.
