abstract:

**Code-generating LLMs have matured** to the point where they can reliably scaffold **data pipelines and data agents**, when used in a **supervised, engineering-first workflow**. This tutorial demonstrates how to combine modern **AI coding assistants** with a **production-ready Python deployment platform (Tower.dev)** to build and operate **real data systems**.

Participants will learn how to structure **collaborative Human/AI Assistant development loops**, where engineers provide **architecture, domain knowledge, and review**, while AI accelerates implementation. We will build a **data pipeline** and a **lightweight data agent**, iterating with an AI assistant to **generate, test, and improve code**.  

The session also covers critical **operational concerns** such as:
- **Security**
- **Scaling**
- **Observability**
- **Debugging**

You will also see how **production feedback can be looped back into the assistant** to continuously improve generated code.

This is **not about “vibe coding”** a website. It is about **disciplined, review-driven AI collaboration** that meaningfully improves productivity for **data practitioners at all levels**.

full_description:

This **90-minute hands-on tutorial** shows how to **design, build, and deploy Python data pipelines and data agents** using AI coding assistants in a **supervised engineering workflow**.

### Outline

- **The state of AI code generation** for data engineering  
- Designing **collaborative Human/LLM development loops**  
- Building a **data pipeline with structured AI assistance**  
- Creating a **simple data agent**  
- Deploying and operating **Python workloads in production** using **Tower.dev** 
- Using **logs, observability, and runtime feedback** to guide AI-driven refactoring  
- **Best practices, risks, and guardrails**

Participants will leave with **practical patterns for integrating AI into real-world data engineering workflows**, from **prototype to production**.
