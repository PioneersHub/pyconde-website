abstract:

The financial industry is rapidly adopting AI technologies, yet the high-stakes nature of finance demands models that are safe, validated, and robust. This talk explores the unique challenges faced by AI in finance, including data scarcity, evolving market conditions, regulatory compliance, and the threat of adversarial attacks. By addressing these challenges with a multi-level approach—spanning data-centric, model-centric, and productization techniques—we'll demonstrate how to build reliable AI systems capable of thriving in this critical domain. Attendees will learn actionable strategies for safeguarding AI workflows and ensuring their models are explainable, resilient, and compliant with regulations.

full_description:

The adoption of AI in finance is growing rapidly, driven by the need for competitive advantage, process automation, and improved customer experiences. However, the high-stakes context of finance—where failures can lead to significant financial loss, reputational damage, regulatory penalties, and even systemic risk—requires a deliberate focus on safety, validation, and robustness.

In this talk, we will break down the challenges of deploying AI systems in finance and present practical solutions across three critical dimensions:

Data-Centric Techniques: Learn how to improve data quality through anonymization, enrichment, and drift detection while using feature engineering to enhance model accuracy. Techniques like balancing datasets and robust validation will also be covered.

Model-Centric Techniques: Explore strategies to create reliable and interpretable models, including ensemble methods, adversarial testing, and fine-tuning hyperparameters. We'll also cover tools to explain predictions and manage bias effectively.

Productization Techniques: Discover best practices for deploying AI systems, including securing endpoints, setting up observability for performance tracking, and implementing robust CI/CD pipelines. Deployment strategies such as canary testing and blue-green deployments will ensure smooth rollouts and risk mitigation.

Real-world examples, such as loan default prediction for thin-file borrowers, will illustrate these techniques, highlighting how they improve reliability and compliance while mitigating risks. This session is ideal for developers, data scientists, and financial professionals seeking to build AI systems that deliver both innovation and trust.
