abstract: Pymorize is designed for large-scale Earth System Modeling post-processing workflows, leveraging Prefect, Dask, and SLURM for orchestration. It handles big data with ease by paralleling tasks, caching results for fast retrieval, and monitoring SLURM jobs in real-time. Perfect for managing complex data operations such as multi-model output integration or regridding, Pymorize automates and streamlines the post-processing pipeline. It simplifies data handling and ensures efficient, scalable workflows for massive datasets, making your data flow seamlessly.
