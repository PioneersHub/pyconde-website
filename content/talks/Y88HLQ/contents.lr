abstract:

Do you want to know more about the communities behind conferences like this one? Why there are two organizations? How do I participate? Until a few years ago I would not have shown much interest in this kind of questions, since then I have started going to PyData and PyCon conferences, joined a local Python meetup and started a PyData meetup. And I want to share with you what I learned along the way.

full_description:

As a Pythonista and Data Scientist, for many years I have never really paid attention to how the tools I use every day are crafted and maintained. I just used them. Then I started going to meetups and conferences and discovered the wonderful group of people that organizes these kind of events. And I decided to try and be part of it. It turns out that Python and PyData communities are extremely welcoming and accessible!

This is a talk about the power of community. It also about two specific communities who are behind conferences PyCon and PyData conferences (and sometimes team up to deliver special events). One is about a programming language and targets developers and the wider public of Python users; it is backed by a non profit called the Python Software Foundation. The other, younger, is about Open Source Scientific Software (it is called PyData but its not only about Python) and targets Scientists, Data Scientist and all people who deal with Data and/or Science in some degrees; it is backed by a non profit called NumFocus.

Why a talk about both? Because I have been wondering a lot recently about the commonalities and specificities of both of them. There is a personal side of this: one of the reason I joined the Python Milan (>10 year old) community is to get involved in starting a PyData Milan chapter. I think, there is also a general trend of convergence between the two: on one side the Data practice is maturing and learning more from the older (still very young) Software Engineering practice; on the other side, the new (neverending?) summer of AI has pushed a lot of developers to start playing with apis delivering the output of sophisticated models.

This talk is divided in three parts each one trying to answer a question:

1. How do the organizations behind Python and PyData communities work?
2. How do I start (or join) a meetup in one of them and keep it going?
3. Why should I care about both (or not)?

The talk aims to be informative, practical, and opinionated and targets beginners and experts alike. It will not be an easy task to be focused and concise about a topic I am passionate about but I will try very hard and I hope you will enjoy it!
