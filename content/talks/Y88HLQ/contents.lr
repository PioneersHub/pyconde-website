abstract: Do you want to know more about the communities behind conferences like this one? Why there are two organizations? How do I participate? Until a few years ago I would not have shown much interest in this kind of questions, since then I have started going to PyData and PyCon conferences, joined a local Python meetup and started a PyData meetup. And I want to share with you what I learned along the way.
