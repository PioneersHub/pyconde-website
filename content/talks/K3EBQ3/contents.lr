abstract: This presentation discusses the challenges of building a database pipeline while using Liquibase for deploymens. I'll share insights and lessons learned after one year of building such a pipeline with a mix of shell scripts, the modernized Oracle command-line client "sqlcl," its integration with Liquibase, Loader and utPLSQL. It is a DevOps presentation that concentrates on real examples of database centric development.
