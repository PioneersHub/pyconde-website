abstract:

Python has been at the center of my work in machine learning and AI for more than a decade. It is where I start from scratch, experiment with ideas, and build systems that help me understand how large language models really work.

In this keynote, we will explore how Python enables this entire journey, from defining model architectures and training loops to scaling data and computation across devices. I will also reflect on how Python continues to support both the large models of today and the evolving systems of tomorrow, even as new backends take over the heavy lifting.
