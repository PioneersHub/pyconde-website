This talk chronicles the development of an AI-powered virtual assistant designed to revolutionize literature reviews for a European agency.
Leveraging LlamaIndex, OpenAI, Claude, and other advanced models, the tool streamlines the process of synthesizing research, providing researchers with rapid 
and accurate insights. The assistant has been applied to assess AI's impact on the labor market, enabling comprehensive reviews of 
academic and grey literature.
This innovative approach not only accelerates the literature review process but also enhances the quality and relevance of research outputs,
supporting policymakers and researchers in addressing complex questions with efficiency.
