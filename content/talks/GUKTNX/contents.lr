abstract:

The recent time series foundation models such as Chronos, Moirai, and TinyTimesMixer promise to change time series forecasting. One change is the ability to perform zero-shot forecasting. However, their performance on specific datasets is often unclear, requiring benchmarking. Such a benchmarking can be performed with the benchmarking module of sktime. sktime is a widely used scikit-learn compatible library for learning with time series. sktime is easily extensible and interoperable with the pydata/numfocus stack. 
This talk presents how everyone can benchmark and compare different time series foundation models for forecasting to determine the best foundation model for the specific use case.

full_description:

In the past years, time series foundation models emerged. They have the potential to change time series forecasting. For example, multiple time series models such as LagLlama, Chronos, Moirai, TinyTimesMixer, etc., promise zero-shot forecasting for arbitrary time series. Furthermore, also sktime started to unify the interfaces of the various foundation models to make the usage of those models easy. 
However, whether these time series foundation models provide added value to various forecasting applications is still unclear. Thus, benchmarking is necessary. In sktime, we have implemented a benchmarking module enabling easy comparison of those time series foundation models on custom datasets and with arbitrary metrics.

Our talk will outline how sktime’s benchmarking module works and how users can use it to evaluate time series foundation models. 
We will show how to combine the benchmarking module with the time series foundation models.
We will show the results of a small benchmarking study using time series foundation models and statistical time series models. 
We will outline our roadmap for time series foundation models. 

sktime is developed by an open community with the aim of ecosystem integration in a commercially neutral, charitable space. We welcome contributions or donations and seek to provide opportunities for anyone worldwide.
