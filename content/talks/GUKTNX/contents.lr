abstract: The recent time series foundation models such as Chronos, Moirai, and TinyTimesMixer promise to change time series forecasting. One change is the ability to perform zero-shot forecasting. However, their performance on specific datasets is often unclear, requiring benchmarking. Such a benchmarking can be performed with the benchmarking module of sktime. sktime is a widely used scikit-learn compatible library for learning with time series. sktime is easily extensible and interoperable with the pydata/numfocus stack.Â 
This talk presents how everyone can benchmark and compare different time series foundation models for forecasting to determine the best foundation model for the specific use case.
