abstract: The deep learning revolution has largely been driven by the availability of big data, enabling significant advancements in data-rich industries like finance and e-commerce. But what about fields where data is scarce, inaccessible, or hard to collect?
In my recent work on crack detection in reinforced concrete structures, I realized how much we rely on data-hungry AI models and why we need systems designed to excel with smaller, more specialized datasets. This realization led me to start exploring the concept of 'small data' not as a limitation, but as an opportunity to rethink how we approach AI development.
This talk will explore how methodologies like self-supervised learning, meta-learning, and advanced data augmentation are enabling intelligent systems to thrive with minimal data. Attendees will gain practical insights into adapting AI to data-scarce domains and leave with a clearer vision of how small data is shaping the future of intelligent, adaptable systems.
