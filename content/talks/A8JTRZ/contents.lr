abstract:

The deep learning revolution has largely been driven by the availability of big data, enabling significant advancements in data-rich industries like finance and e-commerce. But what about fields where data is scarce, inaccessible, or hard to collect?
In my recent work on crack detection in reinforced concrete structures, I realized how much we rely on data-hungry AI models and why we need systems designed to excel with smaller, more specialized datasets. This realization led me to start exploring the concept of 'small data' not as a limitation, but as an opportunity to rethink how we approach AI development.
This talk will explore how methodologies like self-supervised learning, meta-learning, and advanced data augmentation are enabling intelligent systems to thrive with minimal data. Attendees will gain practical insights into adapting AI to data-scarce domains and leave with a clearer vision of how small data is shaping the future of intelligent, adaptable systems.

full_description:

Big data dominated AI’s rise, but the future belongs to small data. Many of the world’s most exciting opportunities exist in environments where large-scale datasets are unavailable or impractical. From rare disease diagnostics to natural disaster prediction and cultural heritage preservation, these fields require innovative AI systems designed to thrive with smaller, high-quality datasets.
This talk will introduce 'small data' as a transformative paradigm for building intelligent, adaptable systems.

We’ll explore:
1. The Paradigm Shift to Small Data: How the concept of small data redefines AI by prioritizing efficiency, adaptability, and inclusivity.
2. Innovative Techniques: Explore how self-supervised learning, meta-learning, Bayesian neural networks, and advanced data augmentation can be applied effectively in small data environments.
3. Critical Evaluation: Analyze the strengths, limitations, and practical applications of these techniques in healthcare, environmental monitoring, and cultural heritage.
4. Real-World Applications: Case studies showcasing the role of small data in these domains.
Actionable Frameworks: Explore structured decision-making frameworks to identify and implement the most effective small data methodologies for various domains.

What You’ll Gain
1. A deep understanding of how small data is enabling smarter, more adaptable AI systems across healthcare, environmental monitoring, and cultural preservation.
2. Practical strategies to design AI solutions that excel with minimal data.
3. A forward-looking perspective on small data’s role in shaping AI’s future, driving innovation, and enabling global inclusivity.
