abstract: Astronomical surveys are growing rapidly in complexity and scale, necessitating accurate, efficient, and reproducible reduction and analysis pipelines. In this talk we explore Pythonic workflow managers to streamline processing large datasets on distributed computing environments.

Modern astronomy generates vast datasets across the electromagnetic spectrum. NASA's flagship James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) provides unprecedented observations that enable deep studies of distant galaxies, cosmic structures, and other astrophysical phenomena. However, these datasets are complex and require intricate calibration and analysis pipelines to transform raw data into meaningful scientific insights.

We will discuss the development and deployment of Pythonic tools, including snakemake and pixi, to construct modular, parallelized workflows for data reduction and analysis. Attendees will learn how these tools automate complex processing steps, optimize performance in distributed computing environments, and ensure reproducibility. Using real-world examples, we will illustrate how these workflows simplify the journey from raw data to actionable scientific insights.
