abstract: The browser serves as our gateway to the internet—the largest repository of knowledge in human history. Proficiency in its use is a core skill across nearly all professions and is becoming increasingly important for Artificial Intelligence. But can Large Action Models (LAMs) autonomously operate a browser? What exactly are LAMs that promise to translate human intentions into actions? We report on a project that fully automates the job application process using AI: from navigating unfamiliar website structures and filling out forms to handling document uploads and cookie banners.
