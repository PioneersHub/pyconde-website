abstract: In the rapidly evolving financial technology landscape, combining Causal AI with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a transformative approach to enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs). This methodology integrates causal inference techniques like do-calculus and counterfactual reasoning into the RAG pipeline, enabling more accurate financial predictions and deeper insights into market dynamics. By explicitly modeling cause-and-effect relationships, this framework improves model transparency and interpretabilityâ€”critical for meeting regulatory demands and mitigating risks associated with "black box" AI. Applications in risk assessment, portfolio optimization, and economic forecasting highlight its potential to drive more informed and reliable financial decision-making.
