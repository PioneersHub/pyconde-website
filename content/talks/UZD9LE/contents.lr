abstract: Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to specific business needs can dramatically reduce compliance risks, optimise operations and improve customer satisfaction. This session provides a step-by-step roadmap, starting with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and progressing to more advanced, domain-driven approaches such as Retrieval-Augmented Adaptation for Fine-Tuning (RAFT). We also explore adaptation techniques, including reinforcement learning (e.g., DPO), that integrate feedback from both human experts and AI systems to ensure that results reflect organisational goals and user preferences.

What sets this talk apart is its focus on combining methodologies - layering RAFT on top of SFT, then adding DPO - to solve challenges in high-stakes areas such as financial compliance. We will show how real and synthetic data can be blended to reduce annotation costs and speed adaptation without sacrificing accuracy. By illustrating these techniques in concrete, compliance-based scenarios, attendees will see exactly how to balance model performance, resource constraints and domain complexity.

Ultimately, attendees will leave with a clear framework for selecting the right fitting strategy: from basic fine-tuning for moderate use cases to more sophisticated solutions for specialised domains. Attendees will also learn how to evaluate the trade-offs between cost, data availability, and model accuracy to maximise the business impact of AI in their own environments.

description: Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to specific business needs can dramatically reduce compliance risks, increase operational efficiency, and improve customer satisfaction. This session provides a clear, practical roadmap for achieving these benefits, starting with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and progressing to advanced, domain-focused adaptations such as Retrieval-Augmented Adaptation for Fine-Tuning (RAFT). We also explore alignment strategies, including reinforcement learning techniques (e.g., RLHF, DPO) that incorporate both human and AI feedback to ensure that model outputs are aligned with organisational goals and user preferences.

A distinctive feature of this talk is its emphasis on combining multiple methods, such as layering RAFT on top of SFT, and then adding RLHF/DPO to address the unique needs of complex domains. We will highlight real-world financial regulatory compliance scenarios to illustrate how these techniques can dramatically improve response accuracy while preserving privacy and reducing annotation overhead. By interweaving real and synthetic data, we demonstrate how practitioners can accelerate model customisation and reduce costs, even under severe data or budget constraints.

In addition to detailing the "how" of each method, we offer insights into why these adjustments matter for business impact, including guidelines for selecting methods based on domain complexity, data availability, and cost considerations. Attendees will leave with a concrete blueprint for using advanced LLM adaptations in their own projects, fully equipped to navigate the trade-offs between model performance, resource allocation, and regulatory compliance.
