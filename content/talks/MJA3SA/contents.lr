abstract:

A useful way of assessing the quality of probabilistic demand forecasts is to compare their performance to that of a theoretically best-possible limit. This theoretical limit can often be found by determining an upper bound to the forecast sharpness, which, in turn, sets a (not-always-achievable) lower bound for the error metrics. In retail, for example, the sharpness limit is typically given by the Poisson distribution. However, there are certain higher order effects that can make the real-world demand deviate from this ideal behavior, making the Poisson limit not always useful as a forecast quality benchmark. A common example of this occurs when the actual sales are constrained by the available stocks, which leads to a right censoring of the demand distribution. In this contribution, we present how to approach this problem as well as the Python-based solution developed at Blue Yonder for enabling adequate forecast quality assessment even in complex scenarios with constrained demand.

full_description:

This talk will present a statistical approach for evaluating the quality of probabilistic demand forecasts without falling into typical traps, and how this approach needs to be adapted to include complex scenarios such as finite capacity (i.e., when the demand is constrained by stocks). We also aim to showcase a Python package developed at Blue Yonder that implements this method and allows data scientists to easily evaluate, visualize and diagnose forecast quality following best practices.
