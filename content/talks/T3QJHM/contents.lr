abstract:

This talk introduces a computer vision-powered system for optimizing bike routes in urban areas like Berlin. By leveraging advanced models such as Mask2Former for semantic segmentation and DINOv2 for feature extraction, the system detects and categorizes bike lanes by safety and identifies cobblestone streets. It integrates these insights into a routing algorithm that prioritizes safe, smooth, and comfortable paths for cyclists. Learn how AI transforms urban cycling by combining safety-focused analysis with practical route planning tools.

full_description:

Urban cycling safety and comfort are critical for encouraging sustainable transportation, yet existing routing tools often overlook these factors. This talk delves into the development of a computer vision-driven system to address this gap. Using street view imagery, the system detects and classifies bike lanes by safety, identifies cobblestone streets, and integrates these insights into a routing algorithm to create the safest and most comfortable bike paths. Attendees will explore the pipeline in detail, from using advanced models like Mask2Former for semantic segmentation and DINOv2 for feature extraction, to clustering techniques for safety assessment and binary classification for road surface detection. This session is ideal for AI enthusiasts, urban planners, and cycling advocates seeking to understand how AI can enhance urban mobility.
