abstract: This talk introduces a computer vision-powered system for optimizing bike routes in urban areas like Berlin. By leveraging advanced models such as Mask2Former for semantic segmentation and DINOv2 for feature extraction, the system detects and categorizes bike lanes by safety and identifies cobblestone streets. It integrates these insights into a routing algorithm that prioritizes safe, smooth, and comfortable paths for cyclists. Learn how AI transforms urban cycling by combining safety-focused analysis with practical route planning tools.
