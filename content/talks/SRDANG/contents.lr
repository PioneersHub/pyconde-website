abstract:

Have you ever considered contributing to Open Source? I did consider it, and it took me more than 3 years to make my first pull request. I’d like to share my experience of contributing to open source: why I did it, what I expected, what I learned, and what others shared with me. I’d like to offer you easy starting points and help you take that first step down the rabbit hole of open source
