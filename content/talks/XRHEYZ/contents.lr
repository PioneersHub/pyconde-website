abstract:

What if we could make the same revolutionary leap for tables that ChatGPT made for text? While foundation models have transformed how we work with text and images, tabular / structured data (spreadsheets and databases) - the backbone of economic and scientific analysis - has been left behind. TabPFN changes this. It's a foundation model that achieves in 2.8 seconds what traditional methods need 4 hours of hyperparameter tuning for - while delivering better results. On datasets up to 10,000 samples, it outperforms every existing Python library, from XGBoost to CatBoost to Autogluon.

Beyond raw performance, TabPFN brings foundation model capabilities to tables: native handling of messy data without preprocessing, built-in uncertainty estimation, synthetic data generation, and transfer learning - all in a few lines of Python code. Whether you're building risk models, accelerating scientific research, or optimizing business decisions, TabPFN represents the next major transformation in how we analyze data. Join us to explore and learn how to leverage these new capabilities in your work.

full_description:

TabPFN shows how foundation model concepts can advance tabular data analysis in Python. Born as research published at ICLR 2023, it found strong community adoption with 1,200+ GitHub stars and 100,000+ downloads. Our upcoming January 2025 release introduces major improvements in speed, scale and capabilities that we're excited to preview at PyCon.
