### Abstract  

Quechua, spoken by over 2.8 million people in Bolivia, is one of the country's most vital indigenous languages, yet it faces significant challenges due to modernization and globalization. This presentation introduces *Quechua AI Preservation*, a project that combines cutting-edge Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, embeddings, and generative AI to revitalize and preserve Quechua.  

By leveraging embeddings for semantic understanding and generative AI to create educational and cultural resources, this initiative aims to address the scarcity of digital linguistic tools and promote the language’s integration into the digital world. Join us as we explore how innovation and cultural heritage can converge to ensure Quechua’s survival and growth for future generations.

### Description  

Quechua is more than a language; it is a gateway to the rich cultural identity of Bolivia, spoken by over 2.8 million people. However, it is increasingly at risk due to declining intergenerational transmission and the effects of globalization. This talk delves into the intersection of technology and cultural preservation, showcasing how cutting-edge NLP techniques can help address these challenges through an innovative project called *Quechua AI Preservation*.  

The project leverages advanced embeddings and generative AI models to create robust tools for the revitalization and preservation of Quechua. By focusing on building accessible digital resources, such as text corpora, translation systems, and conversational agents, *Quechua AI Preservation* aims to bring the language into the digital sphere.  

We will discuss the current state of Quechua linguistic resources, the technical challenges of working with low-resource languages, and how embeddings can provide semantic understanding even with limited data. Additionally, we will explore how generative AI can assist in creating educational materials, cultural content, and digital tools that empower Quechua-speaking communities.  

This session is designed to inspire the Python and NLP community to actively participate in *Quechua AI Preservation*. By integrating state-of-the-art technologies, we can ensure that Quechua not only survives but thrives in the digital age, paving the way for its continued transmission to future generations.
