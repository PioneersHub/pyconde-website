Quechua, spoken by over 2.8 million people in Bolivia, is one of the country's most vital indigenous languages, yet it faces significant challenges due to modernization and globalization. This presentation introduces *Quechua AI Preservation*, a project that combines cutting-edge Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, embeddings, and generative AI to revitalize and preserve Quechua.  

By leveraging embeddings for semantic understanding and generative AI to create educational and cultural resources, this initiative aims to address the scarcity of digital linguistic tools and promote the language’s integration into the digital world. Join us as we explore how innovation and cultural heritage can converge to ensure Quechua’s survival and growth for future generations.
