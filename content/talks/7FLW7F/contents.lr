abstract:

At Blue Yonder, we're embarking on a journey toward building composable AI agents using Model Context Protocol (MCP). We're discovering firsthand the challenges of integrating diverse products and APIs into useful, context-aware agents. In this talk, I'll discuss our early experiences, the challenges we've faced, and why MCP is emerging as a potential game changer for developing scalable, flexible AI solutions.

full_description:

In this talk, I'll share our journey with MCP at Blue Yonder, explaining why this protocol is becoming crucial for anyone involved in building AI agents. We'll start by understanding what an agent really is - essentially a clever brain leveraging powerful tools - and why composability is the key to efficient development.

You'll discover what MCP is, how it's already shaping popular tools like Cursor and Claude Desktop, and why developers everywhere are excited about it. I'll dive into practical insights, showing how agents like Manus, a highly regarded agent hailed as the next "DeepSeek" moment, achieved success simply by combining 29 MCP-compliant tools effectively. This demonstrates the power of composing existing capabilities rather than reinventing the wheel.

We'll also explore how MCP empowers organizations. Using MCP SDKs and OpenAPI wrappers, even teams without extensive AI expertise can rapidly transform existing APIs into sophisticated, usable AI agents. But there's no silver bullet. I'll frankly discuss some organizational challenges, including the tendency to chase flashy "new" agents over contributing collaboratively to existing solutions.

Finally, we'll look ahead to an exciting future, envisioning a world where entire product ecosystems are MCP-enabled. Imagine agents seamlessly orchestrating tasks across multiple products, unlocking entirely new possibilities in user interaction.

Join me for an engaging session, learn from our experiences, and see how MCP can reshape your approach to building the next generation of composable AI agents.
