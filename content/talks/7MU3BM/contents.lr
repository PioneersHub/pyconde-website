abstract: Unifying large language models (LLMs) and knowledge graphs (KGs) can address the shortcomings of LLMs such as lack of factual knowledge, hallucinations and lack of interpretability. Integrating LLMs with knowledge graphs enhances accuracy, contextual understanding, and scalability by leveraging structured, interconnected data. This synergy between LLMs and KGs not only enhances knowledge representation but also streamlines processes such as construction, completion, and querying, paving the way for more intelligent systems in various applications.
