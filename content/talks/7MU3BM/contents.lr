abstract: Unifying large language models (LLMs) and knowledge graphs (KGs) can address the shortcomings of LLMs such as lack of factual knowledge, hallucinations and lack of interpretability. Integrating LLMs with knowledge graphs enhances accuracy, contextual understanding, and scalability by leveraging structured, interconnected data. This synergy between LLMs and KGs not only enhances knowledge representation but also streamlines processes such as construction, completion, and querying, paving the way for more intelligent systems in various applications.

description: In this presentation, the main aspects which would be discussed

1. KG-enhanced LLMs generation, which incorporate KGs during the pre-training and inference phases of LLMs 
2. LLM-augmented KGs, that leverage for KG completion by Entity discovery, Relation extraction, End-to-End KG construction, and Distilling KGs from LLMs 
3. Synergized LLMs with KGs, which is bidirectional with focus on knowledge representation and reasoning
4. Evaluation and Benchmarking: LLM-KG-Bench an automated and continuous evaluation platform 

Elaborating the Graph RAGs techniques that are designed to extract meaningful structured data from unstructured in order make substantial improvements in LLM generation. 

Describing an use case for synergising LLM and KG: generation of personalised educational pathways for school students aspiring for higher education. The aspects of discussion includes,  the constructing of education knowledge graph using language models by preprocessing the data, extract entities, relationships, and construct these graphs from scratch or update the existing ones such as Knowledge Graph for University Curriculum Recommendation (EducOnto) and the E-OED framework (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.09296v1)

Finally a short summary and outlook on the further developments
