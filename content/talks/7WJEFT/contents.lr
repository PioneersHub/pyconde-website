abstract: How can generative AI transform natural language into structured formats, like converting free-form queries into SQL, while maintaining accuracy and consistency? This session tackles the challenges of using transformer-based models for structured extraction and introduces best practices for building fine-tuning datasets and leveraging Constrained Generative AI to eliminate syntactic errors. We will also explore preprocessing, data generation, and augmentation techniques that achieved near-perfect accuracy in extracting dates and times from text. The framework presented is versatile and applicable to extracting any structured data from unstructured text, empowering attendees to create more robust NLP solutions.
