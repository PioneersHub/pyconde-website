abstract: In the era of Generative AI, Text-to-SQL is revolutionising database interactions by translating natural language into SQL queries. While models like GPT, CodeLlama, and SQLCoder excel at SQL generation, they falter when dealing with the complexities of custom databases. This is where Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) steps in, providing context to improve query accuracy. However, RAG’s effectiveness depends on the quality of its embedding model, which often struggles with vague table and column names or overlapping names across tables - perfect example of *"garbage in, garbage out"*. In this talk, Aarti will share practical strategies for fine-tuning embedding models to better handle custom databases, enabling more accurate and relevant SQL generation.
