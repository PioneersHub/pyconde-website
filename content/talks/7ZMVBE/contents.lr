abstract: Every woman has difficulties in life while choosing a career and establishing objectives. Coming from a marginalized community where women fight for respect, opportunities, and recognition, I would like to share my experiences in this talk about how attending a women's university and being exposed to tech communities like Python and PyLadies helped me find the right people who gave me the warmth and confidence to choose the right job, the right skills, and the right attitude to advance in life and achieve more.
