abstract: The Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) is focused on improving the security and resilience of digital products. But to comply with the CRA, businesses will need to start preparing the necessary evidence to ensure compliance if they want to continue to deliver digital products to the EU market once the CRA is in force. 

Key requirements within the CRA include implementing robust security measures throughout the product life-cycle, adopting secure development practices and implementing proactive vulnerability management processes.

This session will show how a number of the requirements for the CRA can be achieved by use of a number of open source Python tools.
