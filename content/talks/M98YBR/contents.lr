abstract: The Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) is focused on improving the security and resilience of digital products. But to comply with the CRA, businesses will need to start preparing the necessary evidence to ensure compliance if they want to continue to deliver digital products to the EU market once the CRA is in force. 

Key requirements within the CRA include implementing robust security measures throughout the product life-cycle, adopting secure development practices and implementing proactive vulnerability management processes.

This session will show how a number of the requirements for the CRA can be achieved by use of a number of open source Python tools.

description: The Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) is aimed at improving the security and resilience of the software components within a digital product. This session will provide a high level overview of the CRA and demonstrate how to enhance software supply chain transparency, manage risks effectively throughout the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), and achieve the necessary compliance by leveraging a suite of open-source Python tools. 

Key areas to be addressed will include:

- Learn how to create comprehensive and high quality SBOMs to gain a clear understanding of all components within your software.
- Discover how to identify and mitigate potential risks and threats within the software supply chain throughout the entire SDLC.
- Explore effective strategies for identifying, assessing, prioritising and remediating software vulnerabilities.
- Understand how to adopt best practices to ensure compliance with relevant regulations and industry standards.

The Python tools/applications to be referenced will include sbom4python, lib4sbom, lib4vex, lib4package, distro2sbom, sbomdiff, sbomaudit and cve-bin-tool.
