abstract: Embeddings are now a popular representation for finding similar items from a collection, but how do you generate them using optimized ONNX models? 

This talk answers that question. Through it, you will learn how to access and load up ONNX models via the Hugging Face Hub. You will also see how to use them to convert multi-modal input (text, images) into embeddings using the ort crate.

In the end, you will walk away with knowledge that equips you with the ability to cut down the time it takes to go from input to embeddings for your self-hosted models. If you do not have Rust knowledge, the ideas are also easily transferrable to Python, as ONNX enables accessibility across multiple languages.
