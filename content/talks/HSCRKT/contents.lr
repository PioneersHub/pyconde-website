abstract: This talk aims to guide attendees through the entire journey of building a Computer Vision system, from the very basics to deploying it as a functional web application using Flask and Docker. Whether you're new to Computer Vision or looking to strengthen your skills, this session will provide hands-on experience with foundational concepts, algorithms, and tools. Starting with image processing, we will progress through essential techniques like object detection, classification, and segmentation, leveraging popular libraries such as OpenCV and TensorFlow. The talk will conclude with a step-by-step guide to deploying a fully functional Computer Vision model in a real-world application using Flask and Docker, empowering you to integrate AI models into production environments with ease.
