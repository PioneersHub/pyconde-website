abstract: Despite the rapid adoption of machine learning, many companies struggle to sustainably integrate ML systems into their infrastructure, tech stacks, and software teams. One of the most significant challenges is monitoring and observability, especially in environments where ML expertise is limited. Existing ML monitoring frameworks are often immature, difficult to integrate, and require niche skills that many software teams do not possess.

We propose a practical, scalable solution: deploying ML models on Kubernetes and leveraging native tools like Prometheus and Fluentbit to monitor three critical layers: system, application, and ML-specific metrics. This includes monitoring system-level resource utilization, application-level prediction latency, and ML-specific metrics such as data drift and SHAP values for model interpretation. By shifting monitoring components to the platform layer, this approach reduces complexity, improves success rates, and empowers software engineers to manage ML products effectively.
