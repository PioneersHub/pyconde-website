abstract: In this session we present OptAB, a data-driven online-updateable antibiotic selection model based on Artificial Intelligence for Sepsis patients considering side-effects. OptAB performs an iterative optimal antibiotic selection for real-world Sepsis patients aimed at minimizing the Sepsis-related organ failure score (SOFA-Score) as treatment success while accounting for nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity as serious antibiotic side-effects. OptAB provides disease course forecasts for (combinations of) the antibiotics Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone and Piperacillin/Tazobactam and learns realistic treatment influences on the SOFA-Score and the side-effect indicating laboratory values creatinine, bilirubin total and alanine-transaminase. OptAB is based on a hybrid AI differential equation algorithm and can handle the special characteristics of patient data including irregular measurements, a large amount of missing values and time-dependent confounding. OptAB's selected optimal antibiotics exhibit faster efficacy than the administered antibiotics.
