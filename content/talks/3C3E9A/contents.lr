abstract:

You prompt. I prompt. We all prompt. But how do you get to the best prompt possible? How do you know this is the right prompt you should use? Meet DSPy - a framework out of Stanford NLP that helps you program, instead of prompt, Large Language Models.

full_description:

AI is moving fast. RAG, vector databases, agents - there’s a lot out there. However, it always starts with one thing: a prompt. You’ve heard about “prompt engineering”. 

In this talk, I’ll show you how to put the “engineering” back into “prompt engineering”. We’ll talk about DSPy. A python framework out of Stanford NLP for programming —rather than prompting—language models. 

We’ll talk about what it is, what problems it solves, and how it can help you design prompts efficiently - instead of relying purely on “vibes.”

Outline:
- Intro - who I am 
- LLMs, agents, and hype
- The state of prompting and dark magic
- What if we could program these
- An introduction to DSPy
- Key use cases
- Leveraging Python, Classes, and Pydantic 
- A simple use case: recipe generation
- Closing thoughts
- Q&A

Note: The outline might change slightly.
