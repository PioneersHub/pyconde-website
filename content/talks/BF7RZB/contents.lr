abstract: Often coming from a background in other languages such as C++ or Java, we make a lot of programming decisions with Python, which are not just non-pythonic, but some can even be classified as noob. (No, it's not about using braces `{}` and semicolons `;` :')

In this talk, we will explore some common `nooby` programming decisions and learn how to make our code adapt to Python's idiomatic style better. Whether you’re just starting or have years of experience, learn to avoid nooby habits and make the most of Python’s simplicity and power. Remember `Simplicity != NoobProof`
