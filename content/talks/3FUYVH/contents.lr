abstract:

"We've only tested the happy path - now users are finding all sorts of creative ways to break the app."

What is already a cause for headaches in traditional software engineering turns into a large challenge when the application is based on machine learning models. It gets even trickier if those models are deployed in an environment where users actively try to game the system. 

After taking a tour of historic cases of models being gamed this keynote will turn interactive engaging the audience in sharing their stories on users playing interesting games with deployed models - including counter moves rolled out.

full_description:

"Collect data, choose an algorithm, train a model to match your target metric and deploy to production." ... sounds easy enough.

But what if user behaviour changes after the model was deployed? What if the deployment of the model itself causes a change in user behaviour? 

This talk will look at examples for models changing user behaviour. In the interactive part the talk will collect stories from the audience.
