abstract: Orchestration is a typical challenge in the data engineering world. Scheduling your data transformation jobs via CRON-jobs is cumbersome and error-prone. Furthermore, with an increasing number of jobs to manage it gets in-oversee able. Tools like Apache Airflow, Dagster, Luigi, and Prefect are known for addressing these challenges but often require additional resources or investment. With the advent of serverless orchestration tools, many of these disadvantages are mitigated, offering a more streamlined and cost-effective solution.

This session provides a comprehensive overview of combining serverless architecture with orchestration. We will start by defining the core concepts of orchestration and serverless technologies and discuss the benefits of integrating them. The talk will then analyze solutions available in the cloud vendor space. Attendees will leave with a well-rounded understanding of the tools and strategies available in serverless orchestration.
