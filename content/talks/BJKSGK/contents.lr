abstract: Topic modelling has come a long way, evolving from traditional statistical methods to leveraging advanced embeddings and neural networks. Python’s diverse library ecosystem includes tools like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) using gensim, Top2Vec, BERTopic, and Contextualized Topic Models (CTM). This talk evaluates these popular approaches using a dataset of UK climate change policies, considering use cases relevant to organisations like DEFRA (Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs). The analysis explores real-time integration, dynamic topic modelling over time, adding new documents, and retrieving similar ones. Attendees will learn the strengths, limitations, and practical applications of each library to make informed decisions for their projects.

description: Objectives:
The session aims to:

1.  Compare Python-based topic modelling libraries, highlighting their relevance to real-world scenarios like policy analysis.
2.    Explore practical use cases, including real-time document integration, tracking topic evolution, and finding similar documents.
3.    Evaluate the tools based on performance, interpretability, scalability, and flexibility, with a focus on climate change policy data presented by [1] focusing on adaptation and mitigation.
4.    Provide actionable guidance on selecting the right library for different project needs and datasets.

Outline:

1. Introduction to Topic Modeling: Overview of traditional and modern approaches, including their practical significance.

2. Algorithms & Libraries Overview: LDA (gensim) [2], CTM [3], Top2Vec [4], BERTopic [5]

3. Dataset and Use Cases:
      - Overview of the UK climate change policy dataset.
      - Use cases inspired by DEFRA and similar organisations, such as:
            - Real-time integration for continuously adding new documents.
            - Tracking topic development over time (dynamic topic modeling).
            - Retrieving similar documents for faster insights.
           (- Classification)

4. Evaluation Criteria: Analysis of libraries based on:
        - Ease of Use: How easy it is for no coding experts
        - Quality: Coherence and diversity of extracted topics.
        - Efficiency: Runtime performance and scalability.
        - Flexibility: Features like contextual embeddings and integration capabilities.
        - Interpretability: Ease of understanding topics and output.

5. Results: Detailed findings, including specific advantages and limitations of each library in supporting the outlined use cases.

6. Practical Recommendations: Guidance on choosing a library based on project goals, dataset characteristics, and organisational needs.

7. Conclusion and Future Directions: Summary of key insights and the evolving role of embedding-based methods in topic modelling.

Outcomes:
By attending this session, participants will:

- Gain an in-depth understanding of Python’s top topic modeling libraries.
- Learn how to apply these tools to real-world challenges in policy analysis and other fields.
- Understand how to handle use cases like real-time document integration and topic evolution over time.
