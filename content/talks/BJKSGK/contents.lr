abstract: Topic modelling has come a long way, evolving from traditional statistical methods to leveraging advanced embeddings and neural networks. Python’s diverse library ecosystem includes tools like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) using gensim, Top2Vec, BERTopic, and Contextualized Topic Models (CTM). This talk evaluates these popular approaches using a dataset of UK climate change policies, considering use cases relevant to organisations like DEFRA (Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs). The analysis explores real-time integration, dynamic topic modelling over time, adding new documents, and retrieving similar ones. Attendees will learn the strengths, limitations, and practical applications of each library to make informed decisions for their projects.
