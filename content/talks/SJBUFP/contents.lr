abstract: This presentation unveils an advanced machine learning model that leverages unique skeletal attributes to achieve robust person identification, providing an alternative to facial recognition in specific use cases.
The core of the model is a Siamese neural network architecture, which is adept at differentiating nuanced characteristics present in skeletal data. The approach often exceeds expectations delivering highly accurate cross-camera and cross-angle identification.
