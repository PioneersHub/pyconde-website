abstract: You have probably heard of vector databases while learning about embeddings used in deep learning models or come across an ad on why you should use one. 
In that case, you might be wondering why not just use SQL databases or NoSQL databases. In this talk you will learn what embeddings are, and what vector databases are, why they are useful and when to use them. Expect to understand why vector databases are preferred for certain applications over SQL and NoSQL databases. We will also work through an example of how vector search works in vector databases and its applications.

Even if you have never heard of vector databases before, come learn how they are powering deep learning systems and search capabilities.
You will get the most out of this session if you have some knowledge of python and SQL databases, but no prior experience with vector embeddings is required.

description: Vector databases have become more commonplace with the adoption of LLMs in various systems. You may have heard of vector databases in passing and are wondering what they are and why they are all the rage despite SQL databases having stood the test of time. You might remember learning about vectors in school and are wondering what's their relation to LLMs.
In this talk, we will learn about vectors, embeddings and vector databases. You will form an understanding of when vector databases are applicable and work through how to use open source vector databases.
This session is excellent for Python developers, data engineers and ML engineers curious about data storage and retrieval in machine learning systems. Join us to learn the basics of vector databases and how they are powering some of the world's AI systems.
