abstract: You have probably heard of vector databases while learning about embeddings used in deep learning models or come across an ad on why you should use one. 
In that case, you might be wondering why not just use SQL databases or NoSQL databases. In this talk you will learn what embeddings are, and what vector databases are, why they are useful and when to use them. Expect to understand why vector databases are preferred for certain applications over SQL and NoSQL databases. We will also work through an example of how vector search works in vector databases and its applications.

Even if you have never heard of vector databases before, come learn how they are powering deep learning systems and search capabilities.
You will get the most out of this session if you have some knowledge of python and SQL databases, but no prior experience with vector embeddings is required.
