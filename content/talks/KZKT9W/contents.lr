abstract: "Don't Repeat Yourself" â€“ a phrase that we have all heard many times. In this talk, we will have an overview how to deal with code duplication and how open-source template libraries such as Copier and Cookiecutter can assist us in managing similarly structured repositories. Furthermore, we will explore how code updates can be automated with the help of the open-source library Renovate Bot. By the end of this session, you will gain insights into these solutions while also questioning whether they truly eliminate repetition or merely contribute to another cycle of automation.
