abstract: Ever wondered how representative Germany's "representative democracy" really is? I did. And I used the freely available data about our "Bundestagsabgeordnete" to analyze how skewed the distribution of age, gender, religion and former profession of our representatives really is. Spoiler alert: there are not too many single mothers who worked part-time at the local bakery before joining the Bundestag. I will give some technical insights about how I parsed and analyzed the data, did some data-wrangling (Berufemapping is not trivial!) and created a Plotly dashboard to visualize the results. I will share some insights about surprising (and some less surprising) findings I had when working with the data and their implications for the current state of our parliament. I will also provide some relevant memes.
