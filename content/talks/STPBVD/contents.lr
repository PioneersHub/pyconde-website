abstract:

Ever wondered how representative Germany's "representative democracy" really is? I did. And I used the freely available data about our "Bundestagsabgeordnete" to analyze how skewed the distribution of age, gender, religion and former profession of our representatives really is. Spoiler alert: there are not too many single mothers who worked part-time at the local bakery before joining the Bundestag. I will give some technical insights about how I parsed and analyzed the data, did some data-wrangling (Berufemapping is not trivial!) and created a Plotly dashboard to visualize the results. I will share some insights about surprising (and some less surprising) findings I had when working with the data and their implications for the current state of our parliament. I will also provide some relevant memes.

full_description:

In this talk I will share both technical insights and political findings I gained when developing the Bundestagsmining project.

# Technical setup
- Git versioned Python code (publicly available at GitHub)
- Dependencies managed with poetry
- Data wrangling and preprocessing using Jupyter notebooks
- Interactive visualization with Plotly/Dash
- Deployment to the Google Cloud Platform using Docker 

# Key findings
- Highly skewed distribution of parliament members regarding:
  - Gender (significant underrepresentation of women)
  - Age (dominance of 50+ age group)
  - Religion (overrepresentation of traditional Christian denominations)
  - Professional background (dominance of legal and academic careers)
- Each party has their own bubble (CDU: white Christian male, SPD: a lot of females but very academic etc)
- even when combining the members of all parties a lot of blind spots remain: 
  - too few young people
  - very few people from non-traditional family structures
  - very few STEM professionals
  - nearly no "blue collar workers"

# Impulses and takeaways for the audience
- be educated about politics and try to gain and empower data literacy
- analyzing data (even as hobby project) can help raise awareness. I will also mention David Kriesel's "Spiegelmining" and David Englert's "Tagesschaumining" as examples for our power of rising political awareness as data scientists
- analysis of publicly available data takes less time and effort than many would think (Python + Jupyter + Git + any cloud is all you need)
