abstract:

Once upon a time, if you wanted to have a highly interactive and responsive web application, Django just would not cut it. A common pattern was (and still is) to build a Python backend application to serve some APIs and then build a separate frontend application using some kind of heavy frontend library or framework such as React, Vue, or Svelte. 

In this talk,  I will demonstrate a stack of tools that can be used to build rich modern frontends in a more Pythonic way.   I'll specifically focus on HTMX, AlpineJS and Playwright.

I'll also cover why tools like HTMX are worth paying attention to for organisations and teams.  It's not just another fad. HTMX is shifting the web development exosystem in some big ways that are very much worth paying attention to.

full_description:

For the most part, this talk will be a demo.  I'll walk through an application built using Django, HTMX, AlpineJS and Tailwind. I will also demonstrate Playwright.

After this I'll get on my soapbox and talk about why tools like HTMX are very much worth paying attention to.  HTMX makes good sense for businesses and it reduces the barrier to entry for junior web developers. This is powerful and worth paying attention to.
