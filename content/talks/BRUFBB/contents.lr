description: Generative AI reaches its full potential when it bridges the gap between structured knowledge in graphs and unstructured data in text. This session dives into the power of **GraphRAG**, a cutting-edge approach to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) that combines these two worlds to create smarter, more context-aware generative workflows.  

Discover how to use a Python package purpose-built for GraphRAG to build hybrid retrieval systems that integrate structured and unstructured knowledge seamlessly. With practical examples and hands-on insights, learn how to power applications like intelligent search, Q&A systems, and personalized recommendations with knowledge-driven generative AI.  

If you're a Python developer eager to innovate at the intersection of Knowledge Graphs and GenAI, this session is your gateway to unlocking new possibilities.
