### Carsten Frommhold

Hi! I am Carsten. I have been working in the data and analytics environment for seven years.  As a data scientist, I am excited by the challenge of translating the business into optimizable algorithms and creating real impact. As a self-taught programmer, I am just as absorbed in the technical challenges, preferably in the cloud.

full_description:

The landscape of data science and AI is evolving at an unprecedented rate. What started as a relatively stable field of mathematical modeling and time-series analysis has transformed into a whirlwind of weekly breakthroughs, especially since the emergence of Large Language Models. How do we stay current without succumbing to FOMO or imposter syndrome?

In this talk, I'll share my personal journey from traditional mathematical modeling to modern AI development, exploring how the field's pace has shifted dramatically. Drawing from real-world experiences as a consultant and team lead, I'll discuss practical strategies for maintaining technical excellence while managing the psychological challenges of rapid technological change. We'll examine how to build effective learning structures within teams, the importance of creating safe spaces for knowledge sharing, and why sometimes it's okay to not be at the cutting edge of every new development.

Through concrete examples and lessons learned, I'll offer insights on balancing client expectations, team growth, and personal development in an era where the technological landscape shifts weekly. Whether you're a seasoned data scientist or just entering the field, this talk will provide practical frameworks for navigating the exciting yet overwhelming world of modern AI development.
