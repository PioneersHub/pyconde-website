abstract: Getting your model into production isn’t a trivial task, but it’s only half the battle. Ensuring that your model continues to deliver great performance over time is even more critical. In this talk I would like to present a selection of what can kill your model’s performance, zoom in on multivariate data drift, and present two methods to detect this type of drift in your production data.
