# Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for Model Predictive Control (MPC)

Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) have made a significant impact in the world of AI, thanks to their ease of interpretability and relatively good performance with small model sizes. These qualities make KANs a promising tool for **Model Predictive Control (MPC)**.

This approach combines KANs with **symbolic regression** to extract **interpretable white-box models** for MPC. KANs are effective at approximating complex systems, and when paired with symbolic regression, they uncover mathematical expressions that represent the system dynamics.

# Pioneering Transparent Models for Electric Motors with KAN and Symbolic Regression

This work introduces an innovative approach that combines **Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs)** with **symbolic regression** to extract **interpretable discrete white-box models**, focusing on a balanced subset of the dataset *"Identifying the Physics Behind an Electric Motor"*, particularly on **three-phase permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs)**.

## Key Highlights:
- **Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs)**:
  - Known for their ability to model **nonlinear dynamics**.
  - Offer **inherent interpretability**, enabling transparent model representation.

- **Symbolic Regression**:
  - Capable of uncovering **concise, human-readable equations**.
  - Enhances the transparency of the predictive models.

## Contribution:
By integrating the strengths of KAN and symbolic regression, this research demonstrates the feasibility of **symbolic KAN** for:
1. **Unveiling interpretable models** that provide insights into the dynamics of PMSMs.
2. **Advancing model predictive control (MPC)** techniques with **transparent and explainable solutions** in electric motor applications.

This approach underscores the potential of symbolic KAN in bridging the gap between complex machine learning models and the need for explainable, physics-informed systems.
