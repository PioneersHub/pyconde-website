abstract: # Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for Model Predictive Control (MPC)

Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) have made a significant impact in the world of AI, thanks to their ease of interpretability and relatively good performance with small model sizes. These qualities make KANs a promising tool for **Model Predictive Control (MPC)**.

This approach combines KANs with **symbolic regression** to extract **interpretable white-box models** for MPC. KANs are effective at approximating complex systems, and when paired with symbolic regression, they uncover mathematical expressions that represent the system dynamics.
