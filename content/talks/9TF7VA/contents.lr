abstract:

This tutorial will guide you through the end-to-end process of geospatial data analysis using Python. We’ll start by exploring OpenStreetMap (OSM) data to extract and manipulate real-world geographic features. You’ll learn how to process and analyze geospatial datasets with Python’s libraries and visualize the results on interactive maps.

Whether you want to map city infrastructure, analyze geographic trends, or build interactive spatial dashboards, this session will give you the tools to get started. By the end, you’ll walk away with a solid foundation in geospatial programming using Python.

full_description:

Geospatial data is at the heart of countless applications, from urban planning to environmental monitoring and logistics. Python’s versatile ecosystem makes it an ideal tool for processing, analyzing, and visualizing geospatial data. In this tutorial, we will take a practical, hands-on approach to working with geospatial data using OpenStreetMap (OSM) as a primary data source.

We will begin by introducing the Python libraries that form the backbone of geospatial analysis, including osmnx, geopandas, and shapely. Using OpenStreetMap, participants will learn how to extract real-world geographic features such as road networks, points of interest, or land use data. From there, we will dive into cleaning and processing the data, focusing on manipulating geospatial datasets, handling projections, and combining data from multiple sources.

Next, we will explore spatial analysis techniques, such as calculating distances, finding optimal routes, and performing geoprocessing tasks. By integrating these capabilities, attendees will uncover insights from geospatial data that can be applied to a wide variety of domains.

Finally, we will visualize our results using both static and interactive maps. Static visualizations will be created with matplotlib and folium, while interactive maps will come to life using kepler.gl and ipyleaflet. Participants will learn how to build engaging visualizations that make their geospatial insights accessible and actionable.

Throughout the session, we will apply these skills in a real-world case study. Together, we will analyze a city’s infrastructure, mapping elements such as public transportation networks, green spaces, or bike paths. This practical example will demonstrate how geospatial data can inform decision-making and foster better understanding of our physical environment.

This tutorial is ideal for Python developers, data scientists, and GIS enthusiasts who want to get started with geospatial programming. No prior GIS knowledge is required - just a basic familiarity with Python. 

By the end of the session, 
participants will have a solid foundation in geospatial data analysis and visualization, along with practical tools and workflows they can immediately apply to their own projects.
