abstract: In today's expansive data landscapes, navigating the vast array of information has become increasingly challenging. Questions such as, "Where can I locate data on our customers' shopping habits?" or "Who is the point of contact for our product descriptions?" frequently arise for data practitioners. And it's not just data scientists and analystsâ€” e.g., business stakeholders often seek clear definitions of KPIs. Furthermore, with recent regulations like the EU AI & Data acts, it's essential to have a robust understanding of your data's origins and transformations.

Data catalogs emerge as essential tools in this complex landscape, specifically designed to address these challenges. This talk will guide you through the world of data catalogs, detailing what they are and the critical role they play in data management. We'll get an overview of the various tools available in the market and showcase the key features of data catalogs using DataHub as an illustrative example.
