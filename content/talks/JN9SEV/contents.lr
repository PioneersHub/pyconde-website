description: Transform your data workflows into interactive web applications using Taipy. Learn how to build, customize, and deploy data-driven applications that bridge the gap between data science and web development, all without leaving the Python ecosystem.

In this hands-on tutorial, attendees will learn how to transform data analysis workflows into production-ready web applications using Taipy. Moving beyond static notebooks and basic dashboards, we'll explore how to build interactive, data-driven applications that can handle real-world scenarios.

Starting with the basics, we'll progressively build towards complex applications, covering everything from data pipelines to interactive visualizations. Attendees will learn how to create responsive user interfaces, handle real-time data updates, and implement best practices for production deployment.
