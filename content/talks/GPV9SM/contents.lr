### Abdullah Taha

Data/MLOps Engineer at Zalando. During my career  I always worked along data scientists to build robust ML pipelines. I am very enthusiastic about designing and implementing scalable and robust systems.

abstract:

Most hyperparameter optimization (HPO) stops at the model boundary. But what happens when your system relies on a complex chain of steps, a short-horizon model, a long-horizon model, ensembles, postprocesses etc? Tuning one piece in isolation often leads to sub-optimal global results.

In this talk, we explore how we used Ray to move beyond simple model tuning. We’ll dive into a "Pipeline-as-a-Trial" architecture where Ray acts as the brain, triggering independent, scalable cloud workflows ( SageMaker Pipelines or Databricks Workflows) for every hyperparameter set.

We will discuss:
* The architectural shift from tuning models to tuning pipelines
* How to build the DAG/pipeline on Sagemaker/Databricks using declarative configs
* How to use Ray to orchestrate heavyweight remote jobs without bottlenecks.

Attendees will learn how to optimize entire pipelines (in a scalable manner on cloud) to minimize global metrics like WAPE, rather than just local model loss.

full_description:

As a data science team working on forecasting, we rarely rely on a single model to produce optimal results. Instead, we run composite pipelines: short and long-term models followed by ensemble strategies, granularity reconciliation, and post-processing. We found that optimizing the parameters of one model in isolation often degraded the performance of the final ensemble or the post-processed output. We needed to treat the entire pipeline as the function to optimize.

This talk details how we implemented a "Pipeline-as-a-Trial" architecture utilising Ray with cloud infrastructure (Sagemaker + Databricks + custom solution).

The solution architecture consists of 2 pieces:
1. The driver notebook (the entrypoint, where the config of the experiment will be parsed and ray initiated). Ray hyperliner will run here and trigger trials for each set of hyperparameters
2. The dag construction and run: each set of hyperparameters (trial) would create and run either a sagemaker pipeline or a databricks workflow. Which would save the results and return the WAPE of the pipeline to the driver notebook

**Operational Challenges:**
We will deep dive into the different trade-offs and hurdles of this implementation:
* Trigger mechanism (how the configs trigger the pipeline?)
* Warm pool support
* Cost
* debugging/monitoring
* Infra limits
