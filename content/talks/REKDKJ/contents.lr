abstract:

We have seen great progress in authentication over the last few years, but authorization is still challenging for most engineering teams.  Enter Fine Grained Authorization, an approach that simplifies access management by leveraging Relationship-Based Access Control (ReBAC), enhancing security, and reducing administrative overhead.

full_description:

In this session, we will navigate the shortcomings of traditional authorization systems like Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) and explore how OpenFGA, with its Relationship-Based Access Control (ReBAC), simplifies access management, enhances security, and reduces administrative overhead by providing fine-grained access control across diverse applications.

Key takeaways from this session are:
1. Gain insight into the limitations of traditional access control models like RBAC and ABAC.
2. Learn how ReBAC can simplify complex access management challenges and enhance security posture.
3. Understand OpenFGA and how it can be leveraged to implement FGA in your applications.
