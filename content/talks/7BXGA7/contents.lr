description: New to Apache Iceberg™ or just starting to test the waters? Time to take the plunge! In this beginner-friendly session, we’ll introduce you to the core features of this high-performance table format and what it has to offer your data team as you build out your modern data lakehouse.

We’ll start by exploring where Iceberg fits within the context of data warehouses, data lakes, and other data storage formats. From there, you’ll be introduced to some of Iceberg’s key features, like schema evolution, hidden partitioning, and ACID-compliant transactions. You’ll see how these capabilities help to solve real-world challenges in scalability, performance, and data consistency. We won’t stop there, though! Next, we’ll go even deeper beneath the surface and explore the open-source tools, query engines, and catalogs that make up the Iceberg ecosystem. Through an end-to-end demo, you’ll see Iceberg in action and learn how you can leverage its features to streamline your data management and drive better insights.

By the end of the session, you’ll have the foundation you need to get started applying Iceberg to solve your own data challenges. So come along, and we’ll take the polar plunge together!
