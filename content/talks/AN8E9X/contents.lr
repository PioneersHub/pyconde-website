abstract: It's getting really difficult for junior developers to start their careers. Most organisations typically don't hire junior developers, they focus on mid level talent and upwards. 

This has consequences for people right now - human potential is being wasted, people are struggling and taking wrong turns.  Training organisations and bootcamps are stepping in to fill gaps with mixed results. There are a lot of sharks in the education space, selling opaque products to people who are looking for answers. 

This also has long term consequences - where will this industry be in 8 years time given that so few people are getting experience right now?  

This is an ecosystem problem. It's very complicated. 

And it's further complicated by the rise of LLMs - we're at the brink of something big, but we aren't sure what. Some people think the skill of writing code will not be necessary in 5 years.

How do we parse this? If we want to play the long game, as a community, as a society, what should we do?
