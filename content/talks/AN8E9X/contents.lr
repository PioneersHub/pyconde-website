### Sheena

My early career saw me working as a software engineer and technical leader across multiple startups. But it was my passion for education that led me to devote the last 5+ years to reimagining how we teach people to code professionally. 

Over the last half decade I have had the opportunity to work in the NGO space and build alternative education systems from the ground up. Along the way I have learned a lot about how to teach well, how to build systems that teach well, and how traditional education systems fall short. 

Now, my primary aim is to spread skills to educators. To empower those who empower others.

I lead the Guild of Educators, a community I founded to empower tech educators through shared resources, support, and evidence-based teaching practices. Additionally, I run Prelude, where I provide rigorous technical training, as well as consultation, and coaching for technical educators, and organisations with education functions (for example grad programs and similar).

abstract:

It's getting really difficult for junior developers to start their careers. Most organisations typically don't hire junior developers, they focus on mid level talent and upwards. 

This has consequences for people right now - human potential is being wasted, people are struggling and taking wrong turns.  Training organisations and bootcamps are stepping in to fill gaps with mixed results. There are a lot of sharks in the education space, selling opaque products to people who are looking for answers. 

This also has long term consequences - where will this industry be in 8 years time given that so few people are getting experience right now?  

This is an ecosystem problem. It's very complicated. 

And it's further complicated by the rise of LLMs - we're at the brink of something big, but we aren't sure what. Some people think the skill of writing code will not be necessary in 5 years.

How do we parse this? If we want to play the long game, as a community, as a society, what should we do?

We'll start by talking about the problem itself: 
- A definition and validation of the problem 
- Why juniors are not adding enough value to be hired
- Why hiring Junior developers is risky 
- How people are hacking the system and making it worse (eg interview hacking makes hiring even more risky)

Next, we'll talk about how organisations and individuals can start to address the problems
- stratergies for organisations
- stratergies for juniors looking to get hired 

The LLM elephant in the room - if we are looking to the futire of this ecosystem, we need to look at the role of a software developer and how that is changing.
