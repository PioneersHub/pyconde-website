abstract: In the right corner, we have the go-to dashboarding solution for showcasing ML models or visualizing data, **STREAMLIT** (\*crowd cheers\*). Simple yet powerful, it defends the throne of Python dashboarding, but have you ever tried to create complex interactions with it? Things like drill-downs or logins, can make your control flow become messy really quick (\*crowd nods knowlingly\*).

And in the left corner, the new contender in the arena of Python web frameworks which, according to its docs, "*excels at building dashboards*", **FastHTML** (\*crowd whoops\*). We will see if this is true, in the **ultimate dashboarding face off** (\*crowd gasps\*). By building the same dashboard, step by step, in both frameworks, investigate their strengths and weaknesses, we will see which framework can claim the crown.
