abstract: "Orchestrating an End-to-End Data Engineering Workflow: Leveraging Python in Apache Beam, Airflow, Cloud Functions, BigQuery, and Gemini AI Models"

This talk explores the synergy between Apache Beam and Apache Airflow, demonstrating how to create a robust, end-to-end data engineering workflow. We'll dive into the challenges of orchestrating complex data processing tasks and show how combining Airflow's scheduling capabilities with Beam's data processing framework can create more efficient and manageable data pipelines. The session will cover integration with Google Cloud Platform services, including Cloud Functions, BigQuery, and Gemini AI models, showcasing a comprehensive approach to modern data engineering. Attendees will gain practical insights into building resilient, scalable data pipelines that meet the demands of data-driven applications in today's AI-powered landscape.
