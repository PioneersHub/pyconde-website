abstract: As NLP models become increasingly prevalent in modern applications, the industry faces a critical challenge: how can we effectively evaluate the limitations of black-box NLP systems? This session introduces a model-agnostic evaluation paradigm that automatically generates test datasets enriched  with labeled linguistic challenges for each example. These labels enable precise analysis of failure cases, uncovering critical flaws and actionable insights. We will also present the development of a performance dashboard that visualizes engine capabilities, fostering better collaboration between data science and product teams. Designed for data scientists and product managers, this session offers practical tools to enhance NLP system performance and reliability.
