abstract: Join us, as we take a hike through the beautiful landscape of Open Source Machine Learning made in Germany.

We will map out this often underrated area of the Open Source Machine Learning world and will discover, that some of the most popular sights (aka libraries) of it, like spaCy, Qdrant or Black Forest Labs have their roots in Germany.

This presentation will not only help you get a better understanding of the libraries, projects and companies affiliated with Open Source in Germany - it will also take you on a poetic tour, making you see the Open Source landscape in an imaginative and illustrated way like never before.
