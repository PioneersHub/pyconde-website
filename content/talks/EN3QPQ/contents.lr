abstract: Generative AI models have shaken up the German market. Since the release of ChatGPT, AI is available and usable for everyone. The number of ChatGPT-based agents is growing rapidly, but concerns about privacy, copyright and ethics remain. Regulation and ethical AI go hand in hand, but are often seen as barriers. The presentation will cover the different aspects of ethics and how they are addressed by regulation. It will give an overview of how to use large language models in a safe and practical way. This won't only address the various ethical issues, but also convince your next customer to invest in your AI-based product.
