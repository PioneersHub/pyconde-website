abstract:

Generative AI models have shaken up the German market. Since the release of ChatGPT, AI is available and usable for everyone. The number of ChatGPT-based agents is growing rapidly, but concerns about privacy, copyright and ethics remain. Regulation and ethical AI go hand in hand, but are often seen as barriers. The presentation will cover the different aspects of ethics and how they are addressed by regulation. It will give an overview of how to use large language models in a safe and practical way. This won't only address the various ethical issues, but also convince your next customer to invest in your AI-based product.

The talk will delve into the complexities of large language models (LLMs), exploring their capabilities and challenges. We'll look at bias in face recognition and word2vec, highlighting cases such as the COMPAS system and Amazon's recruitment tool, which have raised concerns about fairness and accuracy. The intersection of LLM and copyright will also be discussed, including the use of copyrighted material in training data and potential infringement issues.  When talking about data, regulations such as the EU AI Act, the CLOUD Act and data privacy will be examined, raising important questions about data sovereignty and cross-border data transfers. 

The environmental impact of LLMs will be addressed, focusing on their significant carbon footprint and the need for sustainable solutions. An overview of the LLM landscape will be provided, including English models and European alternatives. By exploring these topics, participants will gain a deeper understanding of the opportunities and challenges presented by LLMs, as well as the regulatory frameworks and best practices that can help mitigate their risks.
