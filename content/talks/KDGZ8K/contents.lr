full_description:

In this presentation, I will discuss my transition from a Data Scientist to a management position. After a brief introduction, I will provide an overview of the key aspects of managerial responsibilities. Then I will share some advice on how to prepare for the transition, what you cannot prepare for, and how to start as a new manager. Ultimately, I will share my perspective on the transition and outline the pros and cons of the new role. 
This talk is particularly relevant to engineers who have recently transitioned to management or are considering a change in roles. It will also be of value for those who are keen to understand the challenges their manager is (probably) facing and how to help them. This session will consist of a few rounds of a brief presentation, followed by an interactive session with the audience.
