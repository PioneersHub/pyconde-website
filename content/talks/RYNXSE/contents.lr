abstract: Software development is hard. It's really hard when your organisation's core business isn't _really_ software development.

Part of this talk is about the technology of developing a network automation setup inside an organisation where the network _is_ the business, and always needs to be live. But that's only the half of it. Any project needs to fit in an overall organisation, and sometimes that organisation can have trouble understanding what you're trying to do, or the way you're trying to do it.

So the talk isn't just about tools â€“ it's about building the capability to do this. Putting together the right team for the job, learning what's needed to know how to develop the right stack, and deploy it confidently.

Anna will talk about her experience on a team in exactly this situation, and the lessons she's learned shifting from the role of networker to software developer, via project manager and people manager, to try to get across how the rest of us can make really cool projects happen inside organisations that, at first glance, might have trouble pulling them off.
