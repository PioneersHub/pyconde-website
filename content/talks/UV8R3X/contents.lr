abstract:

Imagine sharing the data with a third party without revealing any information while still proving you own the data. 

The core of this talk is about using autogen framework (PyAutogen made by microsoft) and TLSNotary protocol (made by tlsnotary.org) . The talk is about leveraging LLM and TLSNotary to make data portable while maintaining privacy. If you're looking for a way to make data portable without compromising on security, check out this talk.

full_description:

The talk is about how to query web servers and share the data with another party in a secure and privacy preserving way. We will showcase the tlsnotary protocol along with it's plugin generation system powered by LLM (autogen framework Pyautogen). 

Takeaways
1. Learn how to use autogen framework to develop AI agents for your applications.
2. Learn about zero knowledge proofs and MPC(multi-party computation).
3. Learn the basics of attesting, proving, and verifying data using TLSNotary.
