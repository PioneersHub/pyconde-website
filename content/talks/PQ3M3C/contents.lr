abstract: RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is an emerging paradigm in AI that combines the strengths of retrieval systems and generative models to deliver context-aware, highly relevant responses. 
By leveraging FastAPI’s robust and Langchain’s modular tools for interacting with language models and knowledge sources, you'll learn how to create an AI assistant application for a shop.

The tutorial covers key concepts, including integrating a vector database for document retrieval, configuring FastAPI endpoints for seamless interaction, and using Langchain to enhance the capabilities of large language models with retrieved context. Whether you're a developer aiming to expand your AI toolkit or a data enthusiast exploring RAG, this step-by-step guide will provide you with the knowledge and skills to design and deploy intelligent, context-driven applications.
