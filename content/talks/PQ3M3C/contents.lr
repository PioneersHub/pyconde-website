abstract:

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is an emerging paradigm in AI that combines the strengths of retrieval systems and generative models to deliver context-aware, highly relevant responses. 
By leveraging FastAPI’s robust and Langchain’s modular tools for interacting with language models and knowledge sources, you'll learn how to create an AI assistant application for a shop.

The tutorial covers key concepts, including integrating a vector database for document retrieval, configuring FastAPI endpoints for seamless interaction, and using Langchain to enhance the capabilities of large language models with retrieved context. Whether you're a developer aiming to expand your AI toolkit or a data enthusiast exploring RAG, this step-by-step guide will provide you with the knowledge and skills to design and deploy intelligent, context-driven applications.

full_description:

In this tutorial, you will learn how to build a *Retrieval-Augmented Generation* (RAG) application using *FastAPI* and *Langchain*. 
RAG combines two powerful components of modern AI systems: retrieval mechanisms to fetch relevant information and generative models to produce contextually accurate outputs. This hybrid approach enables applications to provide precise, knowledge-driven responses by grounding generative AI in reliable data sources.

Key concepts covered include:

- Data Storage and Retrieval: Learn how to ingest data into a vector database.
- Langchain Pipelines: Use *Langchain* to link your language model to external knowledge bases, enabling it to retrieve context and generate grounded responses. 
- FastAPI Integration: Build RESTful endpoints to facilitate interaction between the client and the backend

By the end of this tutorial, you’ll have a fully functional RAG application that can serve as a foundation for solving real-world challenges. Whether you're building an AI-powered assistant, improving customer support systems, or enhancing research tools, this guide provides practical, hands-on knowledge for turning ideas into reality with FastAPI and Langchain.
