abstract: Flame cutting is a method where metals are efficiently cut using precise control of the oxygen jet and consistent mixing of fuel gas. The condition of the nozzle is changing over time: deposits formed during the cutting process can degrade the flame quality, reducing the precision of the cut. Traditionally, nozzles suspected of wear are sent back for manual inspection, where experts evaluated the flame visually and audibly to determine whether repair or replacement is needed. This project leverages machine learning to optimize this process by analyzing acoustic emission data.
