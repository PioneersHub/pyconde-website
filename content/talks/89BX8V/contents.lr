### Dominik Falkner

Dominik Falkner completed his bachelor's degree in Software Engineering in 2018 and his master's degree in Data Science and Engineering with a specialization in Data Analysis in Production and Marketing at Hagenberg University of Applied Sciences in 2020. 

During his studies, he already worked on various software systems, including some for collecting and storing data. Since 2019, he has been employed by the RISC Software GmbH as a Data Scientist, working in customer and research projects. His interests and focus lie in the following disciplines:

    Employing machine learning techniques.
    The fusion of expert knowledge and machine learning methods
    Predictive and prescriptive analytics
    Design and architecture of software systems

In the course of his work as a Data Scientist, he mainly deals with time series analyses and classification settings from various industries. In 2022 he will start his PhD studies at the Institute for Formal Models and Verification at Johannes Kepler University in Linz.

abstract:

Flame cutting is a method where metals are efficiently cut using precise control of the oxygen jet and consistent mixing of fuel gas. The condition of the nozzle is changing over time: deposits formed during the cutting process can degrade the flame quality, reducing the precision of the cut. Traditionally, nozzles suspected of wear are sent back for manual inspection, where experts evaluated the flame visually and audibly to determine whether repair or replacement is needed. This project leverages machine learning to optimize this process by analyzing acoustic emission data.

full_description:

Flame cutting is a method where metals are efficiently cut using precise control of the oxygen jet and consistent mixing of fuel gas. The condition of the nozzle is changing over time: deposits formed during the cutting process degrade the flame quality, reducing the precision of the cut. Currently, nozzle testing relies on manual inspections, where experts visually and audibly evaluate the flame. This method is risky, as worn nozzles may remain in operation, posing safety hazards through ejection of high-temperature material. Additionally, the process is costly, especially when industrial equipment is damaged.

Laboratory Evaluation: This section outlines the preliminary experiments aimed at assessing whether this sensor is suitable for distinguishing different machine states. The experiments focus on identifying the optimal sensor placement and analyzing how various machine states impact sensor readings. The design process for the laboratory experiments and the subsequent systematic data collection is shown. The results suggest that while detecting every machine state may not be feasible, the sensor shows promise in identifying degraded nozzles.

Data Preprocessing & Annotation: For a proof of concept, the raw acoustic emission data required manual labeling, as prior assessments depended on expert evaluations. Here, we utilized Label Studio, an annotation tool that streamlines the labeling process. 
Modelling  & Feature Engineering: We extract features using statistical methods and transform the acoustic emission signals into the frequency domain through scipy, focusing on features in  the frequency domain.

Evaluation: We discuss the approach for splitting the data, considering that multiple observations from the same nozzle are present. In a computational study, we evaluate the feature sets developed in the previous step using two different classification models: Support Vector Classifier and Multilayer Perceptron. This section explains how the experiments are computed and parallelized including the time required for execution.

Lastly, we discuss the dataset's limitations and the challenges faced during development. We also highlight steps taken to improve generalization and provide an outlook on future objectives, mostly aimed at a broader applicability of the models.
