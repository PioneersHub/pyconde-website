description: This talk explores the rapidly evolving landscape of modern data architectures that build and used for analytics purposes. They continually adapt practices and tools from software engineering. 

We will explore the growing influence of software engineering within the data ecosystem. Speaking of software engineering: the integration of analytics systems with the transactional/operative systems will also be taken into account. Typical scenarios and contextual factors of different architectural approaches we will also be discussed. 

We take a look into recent developments such as Data Mesh and Data Lakehouse, the ELT pattern, Cloud DWHs and theirlike. 

Additionally, I provide insights into the practical implementation of these architectures using tools and technologies commonly found in the “Modern Data Stack.”

What will you learn:

- Data Architecture and Data Engineering is heavily entangled with Software Engineering
- The methods and processes used are far away from the old UI tools for ETL but very close to existing engineering best practices
- Providing and using data for analytics purpose is by now a topic for every developer team. It's worth to understand the key ideas behind data architectures. You will learn them here. This includes concepts like Data Mesh or Lake but also concrete tooling like dbt.
