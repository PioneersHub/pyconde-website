abstract:

[Polars](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars) expressions are at the core of why the Polars API is so flexible and intuitive, but there are hundreds of expressions available.

This talk will give an overview of the 9 namespaces of Polars expressions, namely `arr`, `bin`, `cat`, `dt`, `list`, `meta`, `name`, `str`, and `struct`.

By showing simple examples of when these namespaces come into play, the audience will become better acquainted with the methods that Polars expressions provide and thus will be better equipped to write efficient data queries with Polars.

full_description:

This talk will introduce briefly the 9 namespaces that Polars expressions have with one or two motivating examples of when the namespace would be needed.

The examples will be simple but representative of what the namespace(s) are used for:
- `arr` and `list` – namespaces that hold all of the functionality to work with the Array and List data types which are commonly mixed together, so we will see when to use one or the other;
- `bin` – namespace that provides functionality to work with binary data;
- `cat` – namespace dedicated to the categorical data type;
- `dt` – large namespace that is useful when working with temporal data, time series, and more;
- `meta` – a namespace that provides tools to manipulate expressions at a meta level;
- `name` – a small but powerful namespace that is essential when working with expression expansion;
- `str` – this namespace provides functionality to work efficiently with strings, which is typically the bane of dataframe libraries; and
- `struct` – an entire namespace dedicated to the data type Struct.
