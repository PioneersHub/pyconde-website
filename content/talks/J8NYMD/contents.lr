### Rodrigo Girão Serrão

Rodrigo Girão Serrão is the author of multiple independently published books on Python, programming, and mathematics, and frequently blogs about those same topics.
Rodrigo has also presented talks and tutorials at some of the largest Python conferences in the world, including PyCon US, EuroPython, and multiple European PyCons.

At Polars, Rodrigo channels his pedagogical skills and his passion for teaching to make Polars more accessible to everyone.
By creating technical content that is easily digestible by those looking to start using, or improve their usage of Polars, Rodrigo is working to help everyone appreciate the elegance and effectiveness of the Polars API.

When he is not working or writing, Rodrigo can be found playing board games, walking his dog, or exercising at the gym.

abstract:

[Polars](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars) expressions are at the core of why the Polars API is so flexible and intuitive, but there are hundreds of expressions available.

This talk will give an overview of the 9 namespaces of Polars expressions, namely `arr`, `bin`, `cat`, `dt`, `list`, `meta`, `name`, `str`, and `struct`.

By showing simple examples of when these namespaces come into play, the audience will become better acquainted with the methods that Polars expressions provide and thus will be better equipped to write efficient data queries with Polars.

full_description:

This talk will introduce briefly the 9 namespaces that Polars expressions have with one or two motivating examples of when the namespace would be needed.

The examples will be simple but representative of what the namespace(s) are used for:
- `arr` and `list` – namespaces that hold all of the functionality to work with the Array and List data types which are commonly mixed together, so we will see when to use one or the other;
- `bin` – namespace that provides functionality to work with binary data;
- `cat` – namespace dedicated to the categorical data type;
- `dt` – large namespace that is useful when working with temporal data, time series, and more;
- `meta` – a namespace that provides tools to manipulate expressions at a meta level;
- `name` – a small but powerful namespace that is essential when working with expression expansion;
- `str` – this namespace provides functionality to work efficiently with strings, which is typically the bane of dataframe libraries; and
- `struct` – an entire namespace dedicated to the data type Struct.
