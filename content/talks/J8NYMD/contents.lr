abstract: [Polars](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars) expressions are at the core of why the Polars API is so flexible and intuitive, but there are hundreds of expressions available.

This talk will give an overview of the 9 namespaces of Polars expressions, namely `arr`, `bin`, `cat`, `dt`, `list`, `meta`, `name`, `str`, and `struct`.

By showing simple examples of when these namespaces come into play, the audience will become better acquainted with the methods that Polars expressions provide and thus will be better equipped to write efficient data queries with Polars.
