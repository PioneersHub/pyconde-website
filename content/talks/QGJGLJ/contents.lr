abstract: Recent Python features make it easier to apply Set-Based Design practices, allowing teams to defer key infrastructure and framework decisions until later stages, guided by empirical data. This talk shows how the Ports-and-Adapters pattern enables systematic, controlled adoption of these practices.

description: Early-stage software projects often face uncertainty when choosing infrastructure stacks and Python frameworks. Decisions like SQL vs. NoSQL, REST vs. GraphQL, or message brokers are influenced by unknowns, evolving constraints, and regulatory requirements. Premature commitments can lead to technical debt, inflated costs, or unmet security needs.

This talk demonstrates how Set-Based Design practices, rooted in manufacturing, can be applied to software development using the Ports-and-Adapters architecture pattern. By isolating core logic from infrastructure choices, this pattern allows teams to defer critical decisions and evaluate options empirically through testing.

Attendees will learn what the Ports-and-Adapters pattern is, how it enables systematic Set-Based Design, and how modern Python features simplify its implementation.
