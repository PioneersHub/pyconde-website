abstract: ORMs like Django and SQLAlchemy have become indispensable in Python development, simplifying the interaction between applications and databases. Yet, their built-in schema migration tools often fall short in projects that require advanced database features or robust CI/CD integration.

In this talk, we’ll explore how you can go beyond the limitations of your ORM’s migration tool. Using Atlas—a language-agnostic schema management tool—as a case study, we’ll demonstrate how Python developers can automate migration planning, leverage advanced database features, and seamlessly integrate database changes into modern CI/CD pipelines.
