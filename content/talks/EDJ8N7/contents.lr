abstract: FastAPI has been constantly growing in popularity during the last years. A lot of this growth is driven by its relative simplicity and ease-of-use. In this talk, we'll discuss some practical insights into building a FastAPI application, based on my experience of migrating an existing Flask prototype to FastAPI. 

We'll explore how FastAPI's core features like Pydantic integration and dependency injection can improve API development, while also talking about the drawbacks of FastAPI.
