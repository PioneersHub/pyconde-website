abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) offers transformative potential for enhancing program monitoring, evaluation, accountability, and learning (MEAL) in humanitarian contexts. In this tutorial presentation, we focus on emergency response and resilience projects. By analyzing vast amounts of textual and spoken data, NLP enables real-time insights into the effectiveness of program interventions, stakeholders' feedback, and evolving ground realities. For monitoring, NLP can extract actionable information from output reports, social media, and community feedback, ensuring programs remain contextualized to the program participant's needs. In evaluation, sentiment analysis and topic modeling identify patterns. Within the multi-language orientation of program participants, machine translation enables multilingual analysis in diverse humanitarian settings. NLP-powered tools streamline accountability by categorizing complaints to enable timely responses and foster trust. Furthermore, NLP drives organizational learning by synthesizing lessons from previous, and current projects and offering evidence-based recommendations for future programming. Despite its potential, challenges such as data quality, contextual relevance, and ethical considerations in data collection and use must be addressed. By leveraging NLP, emergency responses and resilience activities can enhance decision-making, ensure more adaptive programming, and ultimately improve outcomes for vulnerable populations.

Description
Natural Language Processing (NLP) offers transformative potential for enhancing program monitoring, evaluation, accountability, and learning (MEAL) in humanitarian contexts. By leveraging its ability to process and analyze large volumes of textual and spoken data, NLP can significantly improve decision-making and shock responsiveness, fostering program participant resilience and program activity adaptation.

1.	Monitoring
NLP tools can process real-time feedback from various sources such as field reports, annual result reports, call logs, social media posts, and program participant surveys. For instance, text classification algorithms can identify recurring themes or emerging risks, such as supply shortages or security concerns. Named Entity Recognition (NER) can track locations, events, or organizations mentioned in reports, providing actionable insights into program performance.
2.	Evaluation
NLP can analyze qualitative data, such as interviews, focus group transcripts, and open-ended survey responses. Sentiment analysis reveals trends in program participant satisfaction, while topic modeling identifies underlying themes or challenges. Multilingual machine translation tools allow organizations to evaluate programs across regions with diverse languages, ensuring inclusivity in feedback analysis.

3.	Accountability
NLP-powered chatbots and automated systems can process complaints and feedback from affected populations. Categorization algorithms can prioritize urgent concerns, such as protection issues or overlooked program participant needs, for faster response. Sentiment analysis helps assess public trust and satisfaction, while text summarization ensures accountability reports are concise yet complete.
4.	Learning
By synthesizing information from past, and ongoing project activities, NLP can extract lessons learned and key success factors. Tools like document clustering and summarization can identify best practices across programs and sectors. Additionally, NLP can facilitate the creation of knowledge repositories, making insights easily accessible to staff and program stakeholders at various level for future planning.

Despite its transformative potential, the application of NLP in humanitarian settings comes with challenges. These include ensuring data quality, addressing bias in algorithms, and adhering to ethical principles in data collection, especially in vulnerable communities. However, with considerate implementation, NLP can help humanitarian organizations make data-driven decisions, adapt to dynamic environments, and ultimately improve outcomes for crisis-affected populations.
