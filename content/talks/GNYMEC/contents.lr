abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) offers transformative potential for enhancing program monitoring, evaluation, accountability, and learning (MEAL) in humanitarian contexts. In this tutorial presentation, we focus on emergency response and resilience projects. By analyzing vast amounts of textual and spoken data, NLP enables real-time insights into the effectiveness of program interventions, stakeholders' feedback, and evolving ground realities. For monitoring, NLP can extract actionable information from output reports, social media, and community feedback, ensuring programs remain contextualized to the program participant's needs. In evaluation, sentiment analysis and topic modeling identify patterns. Within the multi-language orientation of program participants, machine translation enables multilingual analysis in diverse humanitarian settings. NLP-powered tools streamline accountability by categorizing complaints to enable timely responses and foster trust. Furthermore, NLP drives organizational learning by synthesizing lessons from previous, and current projects and offering evidence-based recommendations for future programming. Despite its potential, challenges such as data quality, contextual relevance, and ethical considerations in data collection and use must be addressed. By leveraging NLP, emergency responses and resilience activities can enhance decision-making, ensure more adaptive programming, and ultimately improve outcomes for vulnerable populations.
