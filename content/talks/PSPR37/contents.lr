abstract:

Join me on the journey of me trying to battle the Sun for a few more precious moments of sleep using MQTT and python. As someone who adores city lights during the night but hates being rudely awakened by the blinding Sun, I embarked on a journey to automate my curtains using Raspberry Pi, stepper motors, micropython and MQTT. From creative ideas to comical mishaps, and eventually stumbling upon a somewhat functional solution, this talk promises laughter, learning, and a peek into the thrillingly world of microprocessors and the MQTT framework.

## Description:

**Target Audience:**

- Aspiring IoT enthusiasts seeking to turn a make an end to end IOT solution.
- Anyone who enjoys learning through laughter and the occasional "print('facepalm')".
- everything else we will cover in the talk.
- some very basic knowledge of python.

**Benefits for Attendees:**

- Gain practical knowledge of **MQTT and its Pythonic potential**.
- Learn to craft **multi-layered solutions** that combine sensors, user control, and API integration.
- Embrace the **iterative nature of development** and learn to laugh at your code (trust me, it helps).

**Outline**

1. Initial Approach and Challenges (5 minutes):
- Introduce the problem of early morning sunlight disrupting sleep.
- Describe the initial attempt using a light sensor and Python script.
1. Introducing MQTT and Setting Up the System (10 minutes):
- Discover the power of MQTT, the messenger of the machine gods!.
- Briefly showcase setting up a Raspberry Pi with an MQTT broker.
- Demonstrate connecting the light sensor to the system and publishing readings.
1. Refining the Solution with User Control and Sunrise Data (10 minutes):
- Acknowledge the limitations of relying solely on sensor data.
- Introduce a mobile app for user control to adjust blinds manually.
- Explain integrating the app with the MQTT broker for communication.
-leveraging an API to retrieve sunrise times and schedule blind adjustments.
1. Lessons Learned and Open Discussion (5 minutes):
- Share the trials and tribulations of the journey, with a dash of humor.
- Open forum for questions and discussions

 ### Why did I choose this topic

As someone who enjoys gazing at the night sky from the comfort of my bed, sunrise has always been a rude awakening. My engineer brain kicked in, and I decided to build a solution!  While the final product might be considered a bit over-engineered and "mostly working," it served a valuable purpose.  Through this project, I gained a deep understanding of how Micropython and MQTT functions and its vast potential.  Most importantly, I learned to laugh off my mistakes and embrace the iterative nature of development.

## **What audience can get from the talk**

- This talk will equip attendees with the skills to build powerful automation systems! *
- Master MQTT: Learn a powerful messaging tool (MQTT) and how to use it seamlessly with Python to connect your devices.
- Build complex projects: Go beyond basic controls. Discover how to combine sensors, user interfaces, and even connect to external services (APIs) to create multi-layered solutions.
- Embrace the journey: Development is all about learning from mistakes. We'll show you how to approach coding with a positive attitude and laugh off the inevitable bumps along the road!

## **Prior knowledges I assume the audience to have**

This talk is perfect for anyone with a basic understanding of Python and a healthy dose of humor (trust me, it will be needed for my jokes!).  While we'll be diving deep into the exciting world of  MQTT and its potential for building smart home solutions, no prior knowledge is required.  Get ready to learn, laugh, and discover the joy of iterative development.
