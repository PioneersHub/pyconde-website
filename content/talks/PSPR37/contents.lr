abstract: Join me on the journey of me trying to battle the Sun for a few more precious moments of sleep using MQTT and python. As someone who adores city lights during the night but hates being rudely awakened by the blinding Sun, I embarked on a journey to automate my curtains using Raspberry Pi, stepper motors, micropython and MQTT. From creative ideas to comical mishaps, and eventually stumbling upon a somewhat functional solution, this talk promises laughter, learning, and a peek into the thrillingly world of microprocessors and the MQTT framework.
