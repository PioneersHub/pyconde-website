abstract:

Generative AI and Large Language Models have rapidly advanced beyond simple question-answering and text summarization tasks. The next frontier lies in harnessing these technologies to create autonomous agents—systems capable of reasoning, planning, and executing complex sequences of actions with minimal human intervention. This talk explores the principles and challenges of designing such agents, focusing on how LLMs can function as core components for decision-making and communication.
We will explore strategies for integrating LLMs with external tools, APIs, and feedback loops, enabling adaptive behavior in dynamic environments. Real-world applications will be highlighted, from task automation and research assistance to creative problem-solving and collaborative workflows. Attendees will gain insights into the architectural frameworks, theoretical foundations and technical considerations necessary to deploy robust and responsible autonomous systems. Whether you're an AI enthusiast, developer, or researcher, this session will provide a roadmap for navigating this exciting and transformative domain.
