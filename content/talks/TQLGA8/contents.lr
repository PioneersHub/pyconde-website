abstract: From watching AI conquer Super Mario to building production-ready Reinforcement Learning (RL) systems, this talk explores how Python developers can dive into RL without requiring advanced degrees or big tech resources. Drawing on our three-year journey of building a production RL system, I’ll show how developers can leverage RL through practical strategies and accessible tools. Using pi_optimal, an open-source RL toolkit, we’ll bridge the gap between cutting-edge RL research and real-world applications. Attendees will gain actionable insights, implementation techniques, and hands-on experience to confidently start their own RL projects.

description: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved groundbreaking results, from dominating video games to optimizing business processes. Despite these successes, a considerable gap exists between RL research and practical, accessible implementation for everyday developers. This talk aims to bridge that gap with hands-on guidance and real-world insights.

Based on our three-year journey of developing a production-grade RL system, we’ll cover:
Translating research papers into functional code

- Avoiding common RL pitfalls
- Techniques to optimize resources without big budgets
- Real-world case studies and key lessons learned

Our experience culminated in the development of pi_optimal, an open-source library that simplifies RL implementation for Python developers. We’ll showcase how pi_optimal makes RL accessible, enabling developers to apply RL principles without needing a PhD or extensive computational resources.
