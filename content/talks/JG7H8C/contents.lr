abstract: As APIs evolve to meet the needs of growing user bases, managing versioning effectively becomes a crucial challenge. Poor versioning strategies, such as duplicating entire applications for every iteration, can lead to significant maintenance burdens and scalability issues. This talk explores the art of API versioning, highlighting why it matters and how to balance flexibility and stability.

description: API versioning is at the heart of maintaining compatibility while enabling evolution, but it’s often a source of frustration for developers and users alike. This session dives into the importance of API versioning, the challenges it presents, and best practices for addressing those challenges. Attendees will explore the drawbacks of “versioning by suffering,” where entire applications or endpoints are duplicated for each version, and discover scalable alternatives like schema-only migrations. 

The talk also examines the principles of Conway’s Law, showing how organizational structure influences API design and how reversing the process can lead to cleaner, more coherent systems. Through real-world examples and actionable insights, this talk provides the tools necessary to design APIs that grow with confidence and clarity, ensuring long-term stability and user satisfaction.
