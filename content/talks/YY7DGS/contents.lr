abstract: The new low-impact monitoring API introduced with PEP 669 allows us to implement tools like debuggers and coverage with only a small performance impact. Contrary to the previous `sys.settrace` based approach, the new API uses bytecode modification internally, which allows it to be much faster and fine-grained.

This talk will cover the basics of Python bytecode and how the new monitoring API is implemented in CPython, explaining along the way why some monitoring API methods are slower than others.
