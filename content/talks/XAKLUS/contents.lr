abstract: Relation extraction (RE) is a critical natural language processing (NLP) task that identifies relationships between entities within text, with applications ranging from knowledge graph construction to automated decision-making. In this study, we explore advanced machine learning techniques, implemented entirely in Python, to tackle the challenges of RE in German legal documentsâ€”a domain characterized by complex syntax, specialized terminology, and limited annotated data. Leveraging Python-based frameworks such as PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, and Scikit-learn, we develop and evaluate few-shot learning methods, including meta-learning and prototypical networks with contrastive loss. To address data scarcity, we generate synthetic data using large language models (LLMs) within the Python ecosystem. This research contributes to the open-source Python community by releasing a novel annotated dataset, reproducible Python code, and an open-access RE tool. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of Python-driven solutions for low-resource NLP tasks, showcasing how Python empowers legal NLP research and facilitates robust experimentation with state-of-the-art methods.
