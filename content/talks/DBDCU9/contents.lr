### Milan Rother

Milan is a freelance developer specializing in numerical simulation and scientific computing tools. Based in Braunschweig with a master's degree in EE from TU Braunschweig, he builds open-source frameworks that bridge engineering practice and Python scientific computing.

As the creator of PathSim, Milan has worked on a range of projects including modeling for biomedical sensors, design automation for integrated circuits, microwave imaging, and most recently nuclear fusion systems. Beyond PathSim, he maintains several scientific computing tools including vectorfitting algorithms, harmonic balance frameworks, and RFIC design tools.

abstract:

When you need to simulate interconnected dynamical systems in Python, scipy.integrate gives you ODE solvers but no structure for managing complex block diagrams, signal routing, or discrete events. MATLAB/Simulink offers this structure but locks you into proprietary tools.

PathSim is an open-source framework that bridges this gap. Born from real engineering challenges in control systems and physics simulation, it brings block diagram modeling to pure Python while supporting modern workflows: stiff system solvers, event handling for hybrid dynamics, co-simulation through FMI, and integration with the scientific Python stack.

In this talk, I'll share the development journey, demonstrate what makes PathSim different from basic ODE solving through live examples (from oscillators to event-driven systems), and show how its architecture enables everything from rapid prototyping to hardware-in-the-loop testing. You'll learn when block diagram simulation is the right tool and how to get started.

## Talk Overview

This talk presents PathSim through its development journey: why it was created, what technical challenges it solves, and how it fits into the scientific Python ecosystem. Rather than just another simulation tool, PathSim addresses a specific gap between low-level ODE solvers and expensive proprietary environments.

## Target Audience

- Engineers and researchers simulating physical systems
- Python developers curious about simulation frameworks
- Anyone who's hit limitations with scipy.integrate for complex systems
- Those interested in the journey of building scientific software

No simulation background required - concepts explained from first principles.

## Talk Structure (30 minutes)

**The Origin Story (4 min)**
- Why build PathSim? Real problems that motivated development
- The gap between scipy.integrate and full simulation environments
- Design decisions: decentralized architecture, pure Python, minimal dependencies

**What Makes Block Diagram Simulation Different? (8 min)**
- Live comparison: same system with scipy.integrate vs PathSim
- Signal routing and interconnections
- The block diagram mental model for complex systems
- When you need structure beyond "write a function, call solve_ivp"

**Core Features Through Examples (12 min)**

*Example 1: Event Handling*
- Bouncing ball with zero-crossing detection
- Why this is hard with basic ODE solvers
- PathSim's event system in action

*Example 2: Stiff Systems*
- Van der Pol oscillator demonstration
- Implicit solver integration (ESDIRK, BDF methods)
- Adaptive timestepping visualization

*Example 3: Hierarchical Modeling*
- Building subsystems and nesting them
- Modularity for large-scale simulations

**Integration & Ecosystem (4 min)**
- Co-simulation capabilities and FMI support
- Hardware-in-the-loop applications
- Custom block development and extensibility
- Integration with other Python tools (control libraries, ML frameworks)

**Getting Started (2 min)**
- Installation and documentation
- Example gallery walkthrough
- Where PathSim fits in your workflow
- Contributing and community

## Key Takeaways

- Understand when block diagram simulation adds value over basic ODE solving
- See practical examples of stiff systems and event handling
- Learn about PathSim's architecture and extensibility
- Know how to integrate simulation into broader Python workflows

## Why This Talk Matters

Many Python users face the "scipy.integrate isn't enough, but I don't want MATLAB" problem. This talk shows there's a middle ground: structured simulation that's open source, Pythonic, and extensible. The development story provides insights into building scientific software, while practical demos show immediate applicability.

The talk emphasizes technical substance over credentials - showing what problems PathSim solves and how, rather than where it's being used.
