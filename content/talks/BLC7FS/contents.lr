### Alexander Zaytsev

I am a data engineer at Blue Yonder, where I build infrastructure for large-scale demand forecasting solutions. My career spans nearly a decade in academia, high-tech R&D, and industry, during which python has been a constant tool across a wide variety of environments. During my PhD in physics, I used python to analyze time-series data from some of the world’s most precise quantum sensors in the search for dark matter. Earlier in my career, I applied python to data analysis and modeling in high-precision laser gyroscope R&D, and today I continue to use it to develop robust, production-grade machine learning systems.

abstract:

Containers are a fundamental part of the modern developer's toolkit, yet they are frequently misunderstood and described as "lightweight virtual machines." This talk demystifies containerization by building a functional, minimal engine from scratch using only the python standard library. We will step away from high-level tools like docker to explore how the linux kernel provides isolation through features like `chroot`. Using a hands-on approach, we will demonstrate how to set up a sandboxed environment, isolate a filesystem, and execute processes within it. This session is designed for developers who use containers daily but haven't yet had the opportunity to look under the hood or explore the underlying operating system principles. By implementing a simplified version of these tools, you will gain a clearer, more practical understanding of the core mechanics that make containerization possible.

full_description:

In modern software development, containers have become a standard tool for deploying code. However, they are frequently misunderstood and described as "lightweight virtual machines." For many developers - especially those transitioning from academia, like myself - the layer between their python code and the operating system kernel is often overlooked. This talk is based on the idea that the best way to understand a concept is to implement it in its simplest form. By bypassing the complexity of modern container orchestrators, we can focus on the fundamental system calls that make isolation possible.

During the session, we will demonstrate the core mechanics of containerization by building a minimal engine in python. We will begin by preparing a root filesystem to show what a container image actually is at its most basic level. We will implement isolation using the `os.chroot()` function to trap a process in a specific directory and will talk about linux namespaces, which isolate what a process can see, and `cgroups`, which limit how much of the hardware resources a process can use.

The main takeaways of this talk include a clear technical distinction between virtual machines and containers and the realization that a container is essentially a process with a restricted view of the host system. You will gain practical knowledge of the `os` module for system-level tasks and the confidence to explore low-level computer science concepts by implementing them in python. By the end of this session, you will have a practical understanding of the basic principles that make containerization possible.
