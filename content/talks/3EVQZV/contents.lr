abstract: Non-researcher data scientists are becoming more common in hospitals. What do they do and why should we expect to see even more of them in the future? And how does hospital data science differ from the data science done in the industry? In this talk I will take you through the emerging role of data scientist at a hospital and explain how it has been implemented in different places.

description: Data scientist is a new and growing role in many hospitals. However, to many outside of hospitals, it is not easy to understand what a data scientists might do in a hospital. 
In my talk I will discuss 
- the reasons why data science is being implemented at hospitals all over Europe
- why it is not enough to have researchers working with AI/ML for healthcare - also in-house data scientists are needed 
- what have been some of the biggest challenges being the first data scientist at a large public hospital and starting up this function from scratch
- how I think the data science work is different between (public) hospitals and private companies
- how the data science function has been organised in different hospitals, mainly focusing on examples from hospitals in Sweden and Unity Health Toronto, Canada
