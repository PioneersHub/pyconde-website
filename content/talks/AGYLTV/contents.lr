### Iason Krommydas

I'm a PhD student in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Rice University, conducting research in high-energy physics as a member of the CMS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. My work focuses on studying Higgs boson decays into two photons, analyzing data collected by the CMS detector, and contributing to software development for large-scale scientific analyses. I'm passionate about scientific computing and open-source tools that enable reproducible and efficient research. I’m maintainer of Awkward Array, an array library for nested, variable-sized data, using NumPy-like idioms, and an author and maintainer of Coffea, a toolkit designed to simplify data analysis in particle physics. With experience in the scientific Python ecosystem, I enjoy building tools that drive insight and accelerate scientific discovery.

abstract:

Python has become the dominant language for scientific computing and data science, largely due to powerful array libraries that enable high-performance numerical computation. This tutorial introduces array-oriented programming as a paradigm and surveys the modern Python array ecosystem.

We'll explore when and how to use different array libraries: NumPy for general-purpose array operations, JAX for automatic differentiation, just-in-time compilation of array-oriented code, and GPU acceleration, Numba for just-in-time compilation of imperative code, and Awkward Array for nested and irregular data structures. Through live demos, we'll show how to think in arrays, discuss the limitations of array-oriented programming, and demonstrate how JIT compilation addresses these challenges.

Whether you're analyzing data, building machine learning models, or doing scientific simulations, understanding the strengths and trade-offs of each library will help you choose the right tool for your problem.

## Overview

Python's dominance in scientific computing and data science stems from its powerful array libraries that enable high-performance numerical computation. This 90-minute tutorial introduces array-oriented programming as a paradigm and surveys the modern Python array ecosystem, helping you understand which tools to use and when.

## What is Array-Oriented Programming?

Array-oriented programming is a paradigm that separates problems into lightweight Python bookkeeping and heavy numerical computation handled by vectorized operations in fast, precompiled libraries. We'll demonstrate how this approach combines Python's ease of use with near-compiled-language performance.

Through live examples, you'll see how array operations can be orders of magnitude faster than explicit loops. This mindset shift—thinking about operations on entire arrays rather than individual elements—is fundamental to effective scientific Python programming.

## The Array Library Landscape

We'll survey the modern Python array ecosystem and when to use each tool:

- **NumPy**: The foundation for general-purpose array operations
- **Numba & JAX**: JIT compilation approaches—when and why to use each
- **Awkward Array**: Handling nested and ragged data structures
- **Large dataset tools**: Brief overview of Dask, Xarray, Zarr, and Blosc2 for distributed computing, labeled arrays, and compression

We'll demonstrate the strengths and limitations of each through live coding examples, showing trade-offs between different approaches.

## Understanding Limitations and Trade-offs

A critical part of choosing the right tool is understanding when array-oriented programming has limitations. We'll discuss challenges like intermediate array overhead and algorithms that don't naturally vectorize, and show how different libraries address these problems.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this tutorial, you will:

1. **Understand array-oriented programming** as a paradigm and how it differs from imperative programming
2. **Know which library to choose** for different problems: NumPy vs. Numba vs. JAX vs. specialized tools
3. **Recognize when array-oriented approaches have limitations** and how to address them with JIT compilation
4. **Handle non-rectilinear data** using libraries like Awkward Array
5. **Work with large datasets** using chunking, compression, and labeled arrays
6. **Write more performant Python code** by applying array-oriented thinking to your own problems

## Prerequisites

Familiarity with Python (loops, functions, if statements) and basic NumPy exposure (what an array is and how to use it). No deep expertise required.

## Target Audience

Data scientists, researchers, and engineers who want to write more efficient Python code, understand the modern array ecosystem, or choose the right tools for their problems.
