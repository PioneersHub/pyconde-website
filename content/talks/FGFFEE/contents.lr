abstract:

Many Python developers are enhancing their Rust knowledge and want to take the next step in translating their understanding of advanced concepts like asynchronous programming. 

In this talk, I'll help you take that step by juxtaposing Python's asyncio with Rust's async ecosystems, tokio and async-std. Through real-world examples and insights from conversations with graingert, co-author of Python's Anyio, we'll explore how each language approaches asynchronous execution, highlighting similarities and differences in syntax, performance, and ecosystem support. 

This talk aims to persuade you that by leveraging Rust's powerful type system and compiler guarantees, we can build fast, reliable async code that's less prone to race conditions and concurrency bugs. Whether you're a Pythonista venturing into Rust or a Rustacean curious about Python's concurrency model, this session will provide practical insights to help you navigate async programming across both languages.

Welcome to RÃ¼stzeit: Prepare to navigate async programming across both ecosystems.
