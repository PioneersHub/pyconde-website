abstract:

The beautiful thing about Python is its versatility and this comes into limelight when working with GeoSpatial data. From plotting interactive and non-interactive maps to manipulating GeoSpatial data, we will see how Python and its various libraries like GeoPandas, Shapely and Plotly can be used effectively with some real life examples. Also, we will discuss some optimisations you can work around to make your code lighter and run faster.

full_description:

In this talk, we will discuss primarily these topics - 
1. Structure of GeoSpatial Data - GeoJson, shape files and MongoDBâ€™s GeoSpatial queries
2. GeoSpatial data cleaning and manipulation
3. Playing around with GeoPandas and Shapely
4. Plotting interactive and non-interactive maps using Plotly
5. Using GeoSpatial queries on MongoDB
6. Avoiding common pitfalls

The technical requirement of this talk is basic understanding of Python.
