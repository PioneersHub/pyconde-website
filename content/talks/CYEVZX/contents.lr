abstract: The beautiful thing about Python is its versatility and this comes into limelight when working with GeoSpatial data. From plotting interactive and non-interactive maps to manipulating GeoSpatial data, we will see how Python and its various libraries like GeoPandas, Shapely and Plotly can be used effectively with some real life examples. Also, we will discuss some optimisations you can work around to make your code lighter and run faster.
