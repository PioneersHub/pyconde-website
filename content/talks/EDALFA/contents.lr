abstract:

This talk aims to make observability easy to understand by breaking it down into three main components: metrics, logs, and traces. Using an “unboxing” approach, we’ll guide attendees step-by-step through building an observability stack with open-source tools like OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, and Grafana, enhanced by AWS for scalability.

The session includes live demos and practical examples, ensuring both newcomers and seasoned DevOps professionals gain valuable, actionable insights. Attendees will leave with a toolkit and a clear path to implementing observability in their environments.

full_description:

Observability often seems complex, with many tools, data sources, and concepts to understand. But what if we looked at it like “unboxing” each part, making it easy to see how everything connects? This talk breaks down observability into simple steps that anyone can follow.

We’ll start with the basics, like metrics, logs, and traces. We use OpenTelemetry to collect data, Prometheus to track metrics, and Grafana to display data. We’ll create an observability stack that’s completely open-source and easy to set up. Each part will be explained in a practical, fun way so you’ll understand how they all work together to give a full view of your system’s health.

We’ll also bring in AWS to show how adding cloud resources can make this setup more scalable and affordable. With hands-on examples and live demos, you’ll see how to build an observability pipeline—from collecting data to viewing it in real-time.

By the end of this talk, you’ll have a practical observability toolkit you can use right away. Whether you’re new to observability or experienced in DevOps, this session will give you a simple, useful path to building observability in your setup.
