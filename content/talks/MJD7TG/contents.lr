abstract: While trees and human brains don't share that many properties regarding their domain, the analysis of the height of a tree and cancer in human brains does.
This talk provides a not-so-serious introduction to the domain of computer vision for pathological use cases. 
Besides a general introduction to (digital) pathology and the technical similarities between satellite images (GeoTIFs) and pathological images (Whole-Slide Images), we will take a look at computer vision (both ML-based and conventional) on Python.
Whether you have never done image processing in Python, are an expert (ready to share some tricks with me), or are just curious to see pictures of a human brain, this talk is for you.
Warning: this talk contains quite abstract pink-ish pictures of human tissue. If you are unsure this is something you are comfortable with (have a friend), do a quick search for "HE-stained whole-slide image".
