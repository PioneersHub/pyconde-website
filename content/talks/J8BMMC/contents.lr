full_description:

As Artificial Intelligence rapidly transforms the technology landscape, leveraging the power of machine learning has become essential for developers. In this talk, Alejandro delves into how the AI revolution is impacting developers and the critical role they play in bringing AI-powered products into production. We will explore the opportunities that Machine Learning is bringing into AI-powered products, as well as the challenges of deploying, scaling, and maintaining these systems in real-world applications such as privacy, security and risk considerations. We will be covering a deep dive of the production ML tooling ecosystem and dive into best practices that have been abstracted from production use-cases of machine learning operations at scale, as well as how to leverage tools to that will allow us to deploy, explain, secure and monitor AI-powered products at scale.
