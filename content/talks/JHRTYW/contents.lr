abstract:

Python is known for its simplicity and flexibility, but when performance matters, even established number-crunching libraries like NumPy can fall short. What if you could keep Python's ease of use and achieving significantly faster execution speeds? In this talk, we’ll explore how to seamlessly integrate C++ into your Python packages to supercharge performance. Whether you’re dealing with heavy computations or performance-critical code, this session will show you how to speedup your code without sacrificing Python's flexibility. Get ready to unlock the best of both worlds: Python’s productivity and C++’s power!

full_description:

This presentation addresses a common challenge faced by Python developers: achieving high performance for computationally expensive tasks. While Python is widely appreciated for its simplicity and readability, it often struggles with performance bottlenecks, especially for loops, CPU-bound tasks, and large-scale numerical computations.

We will demonstrate how integrating C++ into Python projects can significantly improve performance while keeping the process approachable and easy to implement, even for developers without advanced C++ skills. By using binding tools, you will learn how to harness the power of C++ with minimal effort and without sacrificing Python’s user-friendly nature.

The talk will highlight:

Practical techniques for integrating C++ into Python with clear examples.
Real-world cases showing how C++ can outperform popular libraries like NumPy.
Simple strategies for splitting Python loops across multiple CPU cores using multithreading.
How to achieve significant speedups with minimal coding changes and accessible tools.
The focus will be on actionable and easy-to-follow insights.

After this session, you will walk away with the confidence to optimize your Python code without deep knowledge of C++ or extensive refactoring.
