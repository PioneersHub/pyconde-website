abstract: Python is known for its simplicity and flexibility, but when performance matters, even established number-crunching libraries like NumPy can fall short. What if you could keep Python's ease of use and achieving significantly faster execution speeds? In this talk, we’ll explore how to seamlessly integrate C++ into your Python packages to supercharge performance. Whether you’re dealing with heavy computations or performance-critical code, this session will show you how to speedup your code without sacrificing Python's flexibility. Get ready to unlock the best of both worlds: Python’s productivity and C++’s power!
