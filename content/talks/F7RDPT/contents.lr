abstract: As publishers increasingly adopt AI agents for content generation and analysis, ensuring output quality and reliability becomes critical. This talk introduces a novel quality assurance framework built with DSPy that addresses the unique challenges of evaluating AI agents in publishing workflows. Using real-world examples from newsroom implementations, I will demonstrate how to design and implement systematic testing pipelines that verify factual accuracy, content consistency, and compliance with editorial standards. Attendees will learn practical techniques for building reliable agent evaluation systems that go beyond simple metrics to ensure AI-generated content meets professional publishing standards.
