abstract:

Have you ever wondered how to automate repetitive or everyday tasks more efficiently? In this session, we will explore the power of Python’s Typer library and learn how to harness it to build command-line interfaces (CLIs) that make your daily workflows smoother and more productive. From creating simple commands to passing parameters in a user-friendly way, this session will cover the fundamentals of using Typer to rapidly prototype tools. We will also delve into real-life applications, demonstrating how these CLI tools can be integrated into GitHub pipelines and other essential development workflows. By the end, you’ll have hands-on experience and a solid understanding of how Typer can enhance automation, boost efficiency, and streamline collaboration in modern software environments.

full_description:

In this session, I’ll explore the fundamental concepts of building Command-Line Interfaces (CLIs) using Python’s Typer library. I’ll cover how to use Arguments, Options, Prompts, and Progress Bars effectively to create powerful and user-friendly CLIs. Additionally, I’ll dive into how to use it in a real-life scenario, such as integrating it into GitHub Pipelines. To ensure a hands-on learning experience, I’ll provide a GitHub repository with examples and exercises where you can build your CLI and set up a GitHub Pipeline that utilizes it.
