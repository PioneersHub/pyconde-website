abstract: Have you ever wondered how to automate repetitive or everyday tasks more efficiently? In this session, we will explore the power of Python’s Typer library and learn how to harness it to build command-line interfaces (CLIs) that make your daily workflows smoother and more productive. From creating simple commands to passing parameters in a user-friendly way, this session will cover the fundamentals of using Typer to rapidly prototype tools. We will also delve into real-life applications, demonstrating how these CLI tools can be integrated into GitHub pipelines and other essential development workflows. By the end, you’ll have hands-on experience and a solid understanding of how Typer can enhance automation, boost efficiency, and streamline collaboration in modern software environments.
