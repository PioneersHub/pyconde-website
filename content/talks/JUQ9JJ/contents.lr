abstract: Generalized linear models (GLMs) are interpretable, relatively quick to train, and specifying them helps the modeler understand the main effects in the data. This makes them a popular choice today to complement other machine-learning approaches. `glum` was conceived with the aim of offering the community an efficient, feature-rich, and Python-first GLM library with a scikit-learn-style API. More recently, we are striving to keep up with PyData community's ongoing push for dataframe-agnosticism.
While `glum` was originally heavily based on `pandas`, with the help of `narwhals`, we are close to being able to fit models on any dataset that the latter supports. This talk presents our experiences with achieving this goal.
