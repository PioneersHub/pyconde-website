abstract: Two major pain points in the Python ecosystem are the reproducibility and portability of your code. In this talk, we’ll bundle code in a conda package and distribute it in an unconventional way. Instead of relying on public hosters, we’ll use self-hosted infrastructure to create our own package index.
