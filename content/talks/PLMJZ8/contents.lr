abstract: The Python community is built on a culture of support, inclusion, and collaboration. Sustaining this welcoming environment requires intentional community-building efforts, which often involve repetitive or time-consuming tasks. These tasks, however, can be automated without compromising their value—freeing up time for meaningful human engagement.

This talk showcases my project aimed at supporting underrepresented groups in tech, specifically through building Python communities on Mastodon and Bluesky. A key part of this initiative is the "Awesome PyLadies" repository, a curated collection of PyLadies blogs and YouTube channels that celebrates their work. To enhance visibility, I created a PyLadies bot for social media. This bot automates regular posts and reposts tagged content, significantly extending their reach and fostering an engaged community.

In this session, I’ll cover:
- The role of automation in community building
- The technical architecture behind the bot
- A hands-on demo on integrating Google’s Gemini into community tools
- Upcoming features and opportunities for collaboration

By combining Python, automation, and modern AI capabilities, we can create thriving, inclusive communities that scale impact while staying true to the human-centered ethos of open source.
