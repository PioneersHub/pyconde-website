abstract: Django's model-view-serializer approach works great for small apps, but as projects grow, you might face challenges like scattered database operations and APIs that are too closely linked to your database models. These issues can make unit testing and scaling harder. I'll share real-world examples of these problems and show how to refactor an app using ideas from Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and hexagonal architecture. We'll look at a before-and-after example to see how these changes can make your app easier to use and debug. Plus, we'll discuss when Django's simplicity is enough and when it's worth adopting a more structured approach. You'll leave with practical tips for transforming your Django projects into systems that can handle increased complexity.
