full_description:

-Advantages and Fundamentals concepts of Conformal Prediction.
Explore the impact of conformal prediction on financial time series forecasting. This talk will introduce the fundamentals of conformal prediction, highlighting its ability to provide reliable uncertainty quantification by generating predictive intervals that encompass real market behaviours. In this way conformal prediction allows investors to make informed decisions despite inherent market volatility.

-MAPIE, Nixtla, and Neural Prophet Python libraries.
I'll present Neural Prophet, Nixtla, and MAPIE libraries that simplify the implementation of Conformal Prediction.

-Practical example of a financial time series.
To bring theory into practice, I'll walk through a use case using Yahoo! Finance's API with a comparison of several statistical and machine learning models.
