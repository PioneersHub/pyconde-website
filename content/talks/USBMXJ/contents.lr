abstract:

Demos have a talent for failing at the worst possible moments. Drawing from real-world experience building demos for thousands of developers, I'll show you how to transform fragile AI pipelines into robust teaching tools that just work. Leave with practical patterns and Python tricks that turn demo disasters into learning delights.

full_description:

Building reliable AI demos is an art that balances wow-factor with actual usefulness. We'll explore battle-tested patterns for graceful degradation, resource management, and interactive learning - all packaged into demos that won't break when you need them most. Through live examples using Gradio and HuggingFace, learn to build demos that both teach and impress, without the "it worked on my machine" syndrome.
