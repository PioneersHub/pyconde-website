abstract: Open table formats have revolutionized analytical, columnar storage on cloud object stores with critical features like ACID compliance and enhanced metadata management, once exclusive to proprietary cloud data warehouses. Delta Lake, Iceberg, and Hudi have significantly advanced over traditional open file formats like Parquet and ORC.

In an effort to modernize our data architecture, we aimed to replace our Parquet-based bronze layer with Delta Lake, anticipating better query performance, reduced maintenance, native support for incremental processing, and more. While our initial pilot showed promise, we encountered unexpected pitfalls that ultimately brought us back to where we began.

Curious? Join me as we shed light on the current state of table formats.
