abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems give users advanced interaction and analysis capabilities with unstructured data and are among the most prominent applications of Large Language Models (LLMs). While building or purchasing a basic RAG system is now straightforward, customizing it for specific use cases and deploying it at scale remains a significant challenge. 

This talk introduces our open-source RAG blueprint designed to streamline configuration and customization, provide integrated monitoring tools, and enable scalability from prototypes to production. Additionally, it incorporates mechanisms for human feedback, LLM-based evaluation metrics and allows privacy-preserving setups.  

Using real-world examples, attendees will learn practical strategies for building open-source based RAG systems tailored to diverse needs, from lightweight knowledge bases to enterprise-grade applications. We will also compare open-source and commercial solutions, highlighting pitfalls, trade-offs, and key considerations in deciding whether to build or buy.
