### Camila Maia

Brazilian software engineer, open source maintainer, and co-founder of Cumbuca Dev, a community-driven initiative that supports underrepresented people entering and thriving in technology through real-world practice, open source collaboration, and education. With over a decade of professional experience, Camila focuses on backend engineering, developer experience, tooling and automation.

She is the creator and core maintainer of ScanAPI, a Python library for automated API integration testing and live documentation that has gathered widespread adoption and community contributions. ScanAPI has been recognized by GitHub as part of initiatives to strengthen the open source supply chain and is used by developers internationally. Camila’s work spans not only code but also documentation, automation pipelines, and contributor experience practices that make open source projects more sustainable.

Camila was the first Brazilian accepted into the GitHub Sponsors program, breaking new ground for maintainers in her country. She is also featured as one of ~50 global open source maintainers in the maintane.rs project, invited by the Open Source Initiative (OSI) to share her personal journey and perspectives on how open source can unlock opportunities in tech.

Her engagement extends to speaking and mentoring at technical conferences around the world, including Pyjamas, EuroPython, Python Brasil, DjangoCon EU, and others, where she has presented both talks and hands-on workshops. 

Through Cumbuca Dev, Camila advocates for practical learning and structured contributions as pathways to real experience, helping people from diverse backgrounds build skills, confidence, and visibility before their first job. She believes that open source is not just code — it is a vehicle for community, opportunity, and empowerment — and her work reflects a commitment to making technology spaces more accessible, collaborative, and humane.

abstract:

Contributing to open source can feel intimidating, even for experienced Python developers. In this hands-on tutorial, participants will make their first real open source contribution to a Python project, learning the complete workflow from fork to pull request.

Using a real-world Python library, attendees will practice reading an unfamiliar codebase, making a small but meaningful change, running tests, and opening a pull request following community standards. The focus is on practical skills, tooling, and confidence — not theory.

By the end of the session, participants will understand how to start contributing to Python open source projects and feel prepared to continue contributing beyond the workshop.

full_description:

Open source is a core pillar of the Python ecosystem, yet many developers struggle to make their first contribution. The barriers are often not technical ability, but uncertainty around workflows, expectations, and collaboration practices.

This 90-minute hands-on tutorial guides participants through their first real contribution to an open source Python project, focusing on clarity, safety, and reproducibility. Rather than working on toy examples, attendees will contribute to ScanAPI, an actively maintained open source Python library used for automated API integration testing and live documentation.

The tutorial is designed to demystify the contribution process while remaining technically grounded and respectful of real-world open source practices.

What participants will learn:

1. Understanding an Open Source Python Project
- How to quickly navigate an unfamiliar Python repository
- Reading project structure, tests, and documentation
- Understanding contribution guidelines and expectations

2. Open Source Workflow in Practice
- Forking and cloning a repository
- Creating a local development environment
- Working with branches and commits

3. Making a First Contribution
- Working on a well-scoped, beginner-friendly issue
- Writing or updating Python code, tests, or documentation
- Running tests locally and validating changes

4. Opening a Pull Request
- Writing a clear and respectful pull request description
- Understanding automated checks (CI)
- Responding to maintainers’ feedback

5. Contributing Sustainably
- How to continue contributing after the workshop
- Common mistakes to avoid
- How open source communities scale through good engineering and collaboration

All tutorial tasks are carefully scoped and prepared in advance to ensure a smooth experience within the 90-minute timeframe. Participants will leave with a forked repository, a commit, and a pull request opened or ready, as well as the confidence to contribute to other Python open source projects.

Why ScanAPI?

ScanAPI is a production-grade Python library distributed via PyPI and maintained in the open. It has been recognized by GitHub as part of initiatives focused on securing the open source supply chain, making it an excellent real-world example of sustainable Python open source development. The project is supported by the Cumbuca Dev open source community, which focuses on building inclusive, contributor-friendly environments through strong engineering practices.
