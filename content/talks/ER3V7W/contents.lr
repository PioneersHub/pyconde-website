abstract: Bias in machine learning models remains a pressing issue, often disproportionately affecting the most vulnerable groups in society. This talk introduces a Bayesian perspective to effectively tackle these challenges, focusing on improving fairness by modeling and addressing bias directly.
You will learn about the interplay between uncertainty, equity, and predictive accuracy, while gaining actionable insights to improve fairness in diverse applications. Using a practical example of a risk-scoring model trained on data with underrepresented minority groups, I will showcase how Bayesian methods compare to traditional techniques, demonstrating their unique potential to mitigate bias while maintaining performance.
