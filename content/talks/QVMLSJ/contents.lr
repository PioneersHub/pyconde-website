abstract: Do you ever find it complicated to learn the complexities of a traditional web framework to push your data science work online? Worry no more! Streamlit might help speed things up as it is designed for the required purpose - creating beautiful data-related web apps that can be deployed in minutes. 

In the hands-on tutorial, weâ€™ll go through various features of Streamlit and build a small lyric fetcher app based on the available dataset (which I have curated and will be sharing the Github link before the talk) of around 24K Billboard top-100 songs. 

Basic understanding of HTML, Python, and libraries such as Numpy, Matplotlib, and Pandas should be good. Ensure you have the said libraries (and wordcloud python library), an editor (Sublime or VSCode), and Streamlit installed in your system.
