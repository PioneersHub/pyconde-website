abstract: Despite an array of regulations implemented by governments and social media platforms worldwide (i.e. famous DSA), the problem of digital abusive speech persists. At the same time, rapid advances in NLP and large language models (LLMs) are opening up new possibilities—and responsibilities—for using this technology to make a positive social impact. Can LLMs streamline content moderation efforts? Are they effective at spotting and countering hate speech, and can they help produce more proactive solutions like text detoxification and counter-speech generation?

In this talk, we will dive into the cutting-edge research and best practices of automatic textual content moderation today. From clarifying core definitions to detailing actionable methods for leveraging multilingual NLP models, we will provide a practical roadmap for researchers, developers, and policymakers aiming to tackle the challenges of harmful online content. Join us to discover how modern NLP can foster safer, more inclusive digital communities.
