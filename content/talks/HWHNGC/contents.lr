description: Code review is central part of everyday developer job. The motivation to create this talk was a quote:
“The most important superpower of a developer is complaining about everybody else's code”. 
Sometimes it’s hard to convince a colleague about change or don’t change some lines of code, in my talk I would like to cover some best practices from my software engineering experience about efficient and honest code review. How to apply automatic tools to improve code review routine of repetitive comments or suggestions. How to write/or reuse codign style guides for you team to reduce time of arguing about naming conventions and different styles.
What’s need to be automated and what’s need to be not automated during code review. The key role of patterns which can be reusable to not confuse colleagues.
