abstract: Despite all the hype around AI, we are still in the early days of finding out the value that generative AI unlocks together with its limits. And while there have been many conversations about the opportunities AI creates, this talk is about its limitations as dictated from the scaling laws and its ability to represent the world.

description: On the one hand AI is supposed to replace knowledge workers and on the other the most popular use of ChatGPT is from students using it to draft essays and complete home assignments. There is no doubt that there are tremendous opportunities to be unlocked even if AI stops improving moving on but letâ€™s talk about the limitations of current technology as well. This can help us inform what we can build now and also which developments help move us forward.

One obvious place to start this discussion is the scaling law that underpins current AI together with a study on how much data is available and how the trend to use lower and lower precision affects our models. A natural next step is to explore the literature around how good of a world representation AI has which will lead us into a discussion of applications that are possible, others that require certain care and lastly those that are out of reach at the moment.

In this talk you will

- get a better understanding and feel of the scaling law that underpins AI
- learn about the world model AI creates and its limits
- see opportunities and limitations of AI informed from that understanding
