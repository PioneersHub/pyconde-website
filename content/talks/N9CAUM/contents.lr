abstract: This talk introduces supplyseer, an open-source Python library that brings advanced analytics to Supply Chain and Logistics. By combining time series embedding techniques, stochastic process modeling, and geopolitical risk analysis, supplyseer helps organizations make data-driven decisions in an increasingly complex global supply chain landscape. The library implements novel approaches like Takens embedding for demand forecasting, Hawkes processes for modeling supply chain events, and Bayesian methods for inventory optimization. Through practical examples and real-world use cases, we'll explore how these mathematical concepts translate into actionable insights for supply chain practitioners.
