abstract:

FastAPI is a Python web framework built on top of the ASGI standard. The fusion of GraphQL and FastAPI emerges as a pivotal approach for constructing agile and scalable microservices. This talk delves into the symbiotic relationship between GraphQL's query flexibility and FastAPI's high-performance capabilities. Attendees will gain insights into seamless integration techniques, leveraging FastAPI's asynchronous framework, dependency injection, and GraphQL's expressive querying.

full_description:

FastAPI makes it easy to build APIs by providing built-in support for common Restful API operations. FastAPI also supports GraphQL federated APIs, which allow you to build a unified API from multiple microservices. With GraphQL federated APIs, you can define a schema that aggregates data from multiple services and returns it as a single response. This talk delves into the symbiotic relationship between GraphQL’s query flexibility and FastAPI’s high-performance capabilities. Attendees will gain insights into seamless integration techniques, leveraging FastAPI’s asynchronous framework, dependency injection, and GraphQL’s expressive querying.
