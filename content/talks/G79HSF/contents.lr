abstract: Learn how we built a strategic demand forecasting application for an automotive OEM, providing insights up to 17 years into the future. This talk covers the challenges of long-term forecasting, the use of Dash for rapid, interactive application development, and Polars for efficient data manipulation. Weâ€™ll explore key planning paradigms (cause-and-effect vs outcome-oriented), the trade-offs of moving away from traditional tools, and lessons learned along the way. Gain practical insights into how to develop fast, flexible planning applications.
