abstract:

As part of the PyConDE & PyData 2025 Conference, we would like to present an initiative aimed primarily at students and those just starting their careers in computer science. Our goal is to showcase the diverse career paths possible and break some myths about typical job skills and responsibilities relevant, so as to inspire and encourage their journey.
