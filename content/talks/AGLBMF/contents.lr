abstract:

Duplicate records can have a negative impact on many areas of a business. Current methods to detect duplicate records use traditional NLP techniques known as “Entity Matching”. An improvement to this traditional method can be achieved by incorporating GenAI techniques that do not entail any calls to OpenAI. Not only does this produce better matches, but it also keeps the data safe, since no information is transferred externally.

full_description:

- A description of the problem of duplicate records and their impact on businesses
- An overview of the proposed solution 
- How to use GenAI models and techniques to identify potential duplicate records
- Step 1: identify your columns to match on 
- Step 2: creating embedding vectors for these columns 
- Step 3: creating match clusters 
- Step 4: presenting those cluster to the users who can then choose what to do with the duplicates
