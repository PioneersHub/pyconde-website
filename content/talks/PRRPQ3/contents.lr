abstract: Modern open source Python data packages offer the opportunity to build and deploy pure Python, production-ready data platforms. Engineers can and do play a big role in helping companies become data-driven by centralising this data, cleaning and modelling it and presenting back to the business. Now more than ever it allows engineers and companies of any size the ability to build data products and insights for relatively low cost. In this talk weâ€™ll walk through the key components of this stack, tooling options available and demo a deployable containerised Python data stack.
