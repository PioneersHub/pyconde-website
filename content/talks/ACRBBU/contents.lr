abstract: Are you looking to take your LinkedIn engagement to the next level? This research project explores actionable strategies to boost LinkedIn performance, using Python’s Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) for text analysis and R’s ggplot2 for data visualization. By diving deep into the most frequent words in LinkedIn posts, the analysis uncovers key themes and topics that capture audience attention.  

A highlight of this study is its comparison of engagement rates for video vs. photo posts, offering insights into which content format resonates more effectively with audiences. Beyond format, the research examines the relationship between impressions (views) and engagement metrics such as likes, comments, and shares. The findings reveal a positive correlation between impressions and engagement, emphasizing the importance of reach in driving interaction.  

Additionally, the study identifies weak engagement rates for posts shared in forums, suggesting that tailored, platform-specific content strategies are essential. On the other hand, posts tied to holidays and observances consistently show the highest engagement rates, providing a powerful strategy for individuals and organizations aiming to amplify their visibility.  

This session will leave attendees with actionable insights, from understanding text-based trends to using data-driven strategies for content optimization. Learn how to transform your LinkedIn presence with smart, engaging content that connects with your audience.
