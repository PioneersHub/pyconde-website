abstract: Processing large volumes of data at low latency is key to enabling real-time and predictive products, but with millions of data points and complex processing requirements, traditional batched data pipelines quickly develop into hour-long dredges and when results are needed in a timely fashion using more resources and running these pipelines at a higher frequency is a pathway to exploding cost and diminishing returns.
Where traditional batch processing approaches just don't cut it anymore, stream processing is the answer. In this talk you'll get an overview of what stream processing is, when to use it, important techniques and frameworks, Python code examples, as well as some tips, caveats and best practices gathered from hard-earned real world experience.
By the end you'll be equipped with all the knowledge you need to start writing streaming pipelines of your own, enabling you to deliver data and insights at sub-second latency.
