abstract: CLOUD, CLOUD, CLOUD!!! Organizations today turn to cloud solutions to reduce costs, accelerate delivery, and streamline operations. Yet, the question remains: how can Python developers thrive in this age of cloud? Enter the Cloud Development Kit (CDK) for Terraform, which empowers teams to build and manage infrastructure using Python in a Pythonic way. This session explores how to apply object-oriented principles to infrastructure-as-code to create cleaner, more maintainable, and testable IaC, while seamlessly managing multiple environments. We will also discuss how leveraging reusable functions and code blocks speeds up delivery timelines and simplifies the maintenance of large-scale projects, ensuring code consistency and reducing duplication. Additionally, we’ll highlight best practices for Terraform CDK— including project organization, code reusability, version control strategies, and testing patterns—to ensure scalable deployments and streamlined cloud management. By the end, attendees will understand how Python’s familiar syntax and Terraform’s infrastructure automation can be combined to reduce operational overhead, boost developer velocity, and ensure robust cloud environments across all stages of development.
