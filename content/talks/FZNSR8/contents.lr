I wanted to start a political party to change Italian politics, but first I needed to understand where our taxes money goes. So I built an agent to crack open government spending data and figure it out!

In this talk I'll tell you the story on how I used Python and AI agents to analyse italian government financials.

I live in Italy, and I'm not a fan of the current government in lots of ways. So I wanted to make a change somehow, and after lots of thinking I thought I should found a party. A political party.

I started brainstorming ideas, reforms to help those in need, create positive changes for the people. Though at a certain point I faced the hard truth. I don't know much about government finance, I can't make plans without knowing how money is spent.

That's when I started toying with the idea of using AI to try and make sense of it all.
