abstract: A key feature of the Python data ecosystem is the reliance on simple but efficient primitives that follow well-defined interfaces to make tools work seamlessly together (Cf. http://data-apis.org/). NumPy provides an in-memory representation for tensors. Dask provides parallelisation of tensor access. Xarray provides metadata linking tensor dimensions. **Zarr** provides a missing feature, namely the scalable, persistent storage for annotated hierarchies of tensors. Defined through a community process, the Zarr specification enables the storage of large out-of-memory datasets locally and in the cloud. Implementations exist in C++, C, Java, Javascript, Julia, and Python, enabling.

This talk presents a systematic approach to understanding and implementing the newer version of [Zarr-Python](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python), i.e. Zarr-Python 3 by explaining the new API, deprecations, new storage backend, improved codec pipeline, etc.

I will also show the performance improvements in ZP-3 while creating, reading and writing async Zarr arrays across local and remote storage like AWS S3.
