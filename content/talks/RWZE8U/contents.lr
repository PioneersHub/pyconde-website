abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at tasks like filtering, summarization, and code generation, but their high computational requirements lead to steep costs and limited scalability. This talk introduces a novel approach that shifts from monolithic LLMs to a lightweight ecosystem of open-source Small Language Models (SLMs) coordinated by a central Master Agent. By dynamically assigning tasks to specialized Worker Agents, each running an SLM tailored for specific functions, the architecture reduces resource consumption and costs while enhancing scalability. Additionally, this multi-agent framework supports edge-compatible solutions, enabling low-latency, privacy-preserving, and offline language processing across various devices. Implemented primarily in Python and leveraging open-source frameworks such as Langchain and Hugging Face, the proposed system optimizes resource utilization, simplifies maintenance through modular specialization, and ensures robust failover for uninterrupted performance. Attendees will explore how to integrate this flexible, future-proof platform into their projects, benefiting from its affordability and adaptability.
