abstract: Pandas, Polars, Koalas, Ibis, Dask, Modin, cuDF, PyArrow, PySpark—just to name a few. To paraphrase a classic, you probably know those aren’t Pokémon names but libraries you can use to manipulate data. The abundance is great, right? Right? In this talk, I’d like to explain the challenges of a pandas-dominated data jungle and how to mitigate those challenges by building dataframe-agnostic data tools.

description: Objectives: Presenting Data Interchange Protocol, Standard Array API, Ibis, and Narwhals, and how they can help you build better and more accessible data tools.

Detailed Abstract: 
1. - Welcome to the Jungle of Data Frame Types: 
An introduction to the world of dataframe manipulation libraries. Why is pandas so popular? What’s gaining traction? Where are we heading?

2. - User Problem = Engineer Problem: 
While learning Polars, I stumbled upon a problem: my favorite tools were built for pandas. Transitioning from pandas to another library limits the choice of auxiliary tools. Why can’t we have data tools that work for a wider range of dataframe libraries? The question I’d like to answer in this talk is: how to build dataframe-agnostic data tools.

3. - How to Build Dataframe-Agnostic Data Tools: When building data tools, you don’t have to choose which dataframe type it should be compatible with—there are solutions that can support multiple dataframe types.

- Comparison of What’s in Store:
Data Interchange Protocol
Standard Array API
Ibis
Narwhals

- Examples of Dataframe-Agnostic Tools:
scikit-learn
scikit-lego
