abstract:

Why do AI projects fail? Spoiler: It’s rarely about the technology. Organizations often stumble over unrealistic expectations, siloed data, and cultural roadblocks. This talk dives into the human and organizational dynamics that cause AI initiatives to derail.

Using real-world examples, I’ll showcase how missing tram stop location data was found on a hobbyist’s blog when official systems failed. Or how critical historical data for resource planning sat locked in Excel files with forgotten passwords, forcing a desperate password recovery operation. These examples highlight the surprising ways poor data governance and lack of interdisciplinary collaboration sabotage even well-intentioned AI projects.

But all is not lost! We’ll explore actionable strategies to navigate these challenges: shifting from shiny tools to R&D-driven approaches, fostering better communication between IT and business teams, and building strong foundations for clean, accessible data. Attendees will leave with insights into what AI success truly requires: cultural readiness, realistic expectations, and a commitment to collaboration.

If you’re tired of AI hype and looking for practical solutions, this talk offers a clear roadmap to ensure AI projects deliver measurable impact.

Why do AI projects fail? Spoiler: It’s rarely about the technology. The real barriers are organizational, cultural, and human. In this talk, we’ll uncover the reasons AI initiatives stumble and explore how to overcome them—through a mix of anecdotes, real-world failures, and actionable best practices.

We begin with a big lamenti—an unfiltered dive into the messy, chaotic world of AI project implementation. From tangled data silos to misaligned expectations, we’ll uncover hard truths through real-world examples that many will recognize:
	•	The missing data problem: Sometimes it’s the smallest datasets that hold the biggest answers.
	•	Passwords might be in retirement.
	•	Decisions in the dark: When untrained people must make calls on things they don’t fully understand.
	•	The shiny facade: Expectations, the pressure for quick wins, and the relentless demand for good news.

To go beyond personal experience, I’ll also bring fresh insights from a survey of my expert network closer to the conference. This will offer a broader, more representative perspective on why AI projects stumble—and how to fix them.
