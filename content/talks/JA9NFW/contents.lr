abstract:

Artificial intelligence is no longer confined to models and APIs‚Äîit now shapes systems, hardware, and real-world agents. In this talk, I reflect on strategic insights gained at NVIDIA‚Äôs GTC 2025, where AI‚Äôs convergence with simulation, synthetic data, and robotics signals a fundamental shift. Drawing from over 1,100 sessions and personal experiences at the heart of Silicon Valley, I explore emerging patterns that redefine what it means to build and deploy AI at scale. We‚Äôll look beyond the hype of large language models to examine autonomous systems, interdisciplinary development, and the infrastructure shifts enabling AI everywhere‚Äîfrom cloud to desktop. This session is a call to technical leaders and practitioners to broaden their perspective, think beyond tools, and engage strategically. Whether you‚Äôre developing agents, managing data pipelines, or scaling AI across teams, this talk will challenge assumptions and highlight what truly matters in 2025 and beyond.

full_description:

Artificial intelligence is expanding beyond the boundaries of models and APIs‚Äîinto real-world agents, high-fidelity simulation, and strategic infrastructure. This talk offers a practical, forward-looking perspective on AI strategy, based on insights gathered at NVIDIA‚Äôs GTC 2025, one of the most influential events in the global AI ecosystem.

We begin with a personal reflection: why attending GTC as an AI consultant helped reset my strategic thinking after experiencing the common challenges of fragmented data, isolated tools, and innovation fatigue. From there, we‚Äôll explore key emerging trends‚Äîagentic AI, synthetic data generation, and real-time digital twins‚Äîand discuss their broader implications for how we design, train, and deploy intelligent systems.

The second part of the talk focuses on convergence: how disciplines such as robotics, healthcare, simulation, and cloud infrastructure are blending, creating new demands for cross-functional collaboration. A brief clustering analysis of 500+ GTC sessions will illustrate this shift.

We‚Äôll conclude by examining strategic changes in AI infrastructure‚Äîespecially the rise of powerful, local AI systems‚Äîand draw lessons from unexpected collaborations (such as Disney, DeepMind, and NVIDIA) that reveal how innovation often happens at the intersection of domains.

This talk is intended for developers, data scientists, and technical leads who want to broaden their understanding of where AI is headed and how to align today‚Äôs decisions with tomorrow‚Äôs possibilities.

Talk Outline:
	‚Ä¢	Introduction: personal motivation and strategic perspective on GTC 2025
	‚Ä¢	Key trends: agentic AI, synthetic data, and real-time simulation
	‚Ä¢	Interdisciplinary convergence: how domains like robotics, biology, and infrastructure intersect
	‚Ä¢	Case study: the Disney‚ÄìDeepMind‚ÄìNVIDIA collaboration and its broader lessons
	‚Ä¢	Strategic implications: shifts in AI infrastructure and a call for action-oriented, cross-domain thinking
