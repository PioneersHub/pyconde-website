description: This presentation explores the challenges of using AWS Lambda for high-traffic Python ASGI applications, including concurrency limits, scalability costs, and transitioning to EC2. We introduce Lynara, a tool that transforms Lambda events into ASGI requests, enabling seamless deployment of frameworks like FastAPI, Starlette, and Django, and simplifying migration to EC2.

Additionally, we showcase Smyth, a local development tool that simulates production environments, enhancing accuracy in testing. Attendees will gain insights into benchmarking framework performance, and improving developer workflows. Learn how Lynara and Smyth address AWS Lambda's limitations to streamline serverless application development.
