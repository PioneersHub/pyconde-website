abstract: Transformers have changed fields like NLP, Computer Vision, sound generation, and even protein-folding. But what about forecasting? This talk will explain how titans like Amazon and Google built a recipe for Foundational Models for Time Series Forecasting.

Most importantly, though, during the talk we will survey the state of the art of open datasets to train such models, and offer practical elements to assess the benchmarks that have been put out.
