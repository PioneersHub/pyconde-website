abstract: Testing data-driven applications often involves significant overhead due to the setup and teardown of resource-intensive systems like databases and cloud services. This talk will explore practical strategies for designing integration and system tests with **pytest** to minimize these inefficiencies. By leveraging techniques to decouple tests while maximizing resource reuse, youâ€™ll learn how to enhance your testing process, improving performance, scalability, and test isolation in your own projects.
