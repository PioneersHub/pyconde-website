abstract:

Anomaly detection is hardly a new problem, nor is the progress in it as rapid as the LLM blast we’re witnessing today. **But it is pressing.**

In this talk, we’ll look at an end-to-end demo of a realtime anomaly detection pipeline and discuss the nitty-gritties of the algorithm knobs that help us build an unbiased and reliable system, which includes using NeuralProphet, an open source framework, to forecast for time series data and robust techniques to detect true anomalies using forecasting errors.

full_description:

With the boom of data, we’re seeing real-time systems cropping up and that means thousands of data streams flowing that power every experience across the internet. But with this, arises the critical need to monitor data quality and metrics, and alerting systems that help escalate unexpected behavior with high confidence. 

In this talk, we’ll focus on one approach to detect anomalies, which is to forecast for a period in the future and alert if the ground truth is far from this prediction by some amount. Easy-peesy, right? But for this to work, we need
- A performant and efficient forecasting algorithm, that works well for all kinds of data, and, 
- An unbiased, and dynamic approach to detect anomalies and not noise 


For the first, we’ll leverage NeuralProphet - which is an open-source framework for ML based forecasting that combines the interpretability of linear models with the accuracy of deep neural networks.
 
For the second, we’ll discuss implementing some robust techniques and how they’re useful in the real-time production environment, to prevent anomalous data biasing our system as early as one second later.



## Outline


1. **Introduction to anomaly detection using time series forecasting** (5 min)
- Overview of NeuralProphet (10 min)
- We’ll discuss the key components of NeuralProphet like capturing trend, seasonality and the AR-nets and what gives it an edge over the traditional statistical forecasting algorithms, using code snippets.
- Using neural prophet in real-time - how many periods to forecast ahead? 
2. **Using forecast errors to detect anomalies** (12 min): 
The questions I’ll address in this section are:
- Which measures should we use as anomaly scores to prevent bias by anomalous data entering the system in real-time?
- How do we choose lookback windows to compare our current data with?
- How do we tune anomaly score thresholds?
- How do we deal with short-term noise?
- How do we deal with sparse data?
3. **Q&A** (3 min)

**At the end of the talk, the audience will**
- have knowledge of an end-to-end demo highlighting NeuralProphet’s capabilities
- be equipped with handy tips and techniques to implement automated anomaly detection using open-source tools.
