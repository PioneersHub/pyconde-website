abstract: Building Streamlit apps is easy for Data Scientists - but when it’s time to deploy them to the cloud, challenges like slow model loading, scalability, and security can become major hurdles. This talk bridges two perspectives: the Data Scientist who builds the app and the MLOps engineer who deploys it. We'll dive into optimizing model loading from Hugging Face Hub, implementing features like autoscaling and authentication, and securing your app against potential threats. By the end of this talk, you’ll be ready to design Streamlit apps that are functional and deployment-ready for the cloud.
