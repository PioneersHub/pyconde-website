full_description:

Learn how to use modern computer vision models for the task of identifying different signals within a spectral image in real time. In this talk, I present our work utilizing YOLO architectures for the task at hand and discuss the challenges involved with a severely limited amount of user-annotated data. The framework used for model training and evaluation is MMYOLO, and we will also touch upon the quality metrics. The system is part of a real-time signal detection process used for scanning private networks.
