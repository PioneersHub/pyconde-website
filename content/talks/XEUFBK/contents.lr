abstract: The role of the software engineer is evolving—from coders of the waterfall era to agile-driven creators and, now, to product-focused strategists. In this talk, we’ll explore how engineers can adapt to modern demands by prioritizing business value, tackling tech debt, and contributing to data-driven discovery. Using a Django application as a practical example, we’ll demonstrate how teams can design architectures that balance flexibility and structure—equipping engineers to thrive in this reimagined role.
