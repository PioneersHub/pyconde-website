abstract:

Join us as we explore integrating Gurobi and prescriptive analytics into your Python ecosystem. In this session, you’ll discover model-building techniques that leverage NumPy and SciPy.sparse as well as the data structures of pandas. We’ll also show you how to seamlessly integrate trained regressors from scikit-learn as constraints in your optimization models. Elevate your workflows and unlock new decision-making capabilities with Gurobi in Python.

full_description:

Gurobi is a prescriptive analytics technology that enables you to make optimal decisions from data. You can use prescriptive analytics to generate optimized decision recommendations, based on real-world variables and constraints. Powered by mathematical models solved by mixed-integer optimization, it enables embedded decision intelligence in all kinds of applications in an industry-agnostic fashion and in any deployment scenario.
