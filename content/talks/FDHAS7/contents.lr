abstract: APIs serve as the critical interface between users and libraries, yet designing an effective API remains a nuanced and often underestimated challenge. In this talk, we’ll explore what makes an API great by focusing on three core principles: simplicity, consistency, and flexibility.

Through a hands-on case study, we’ll iteratively improve a real-world API, showcasing practical techniques for identifying and addressing pain points. Along the way, we’ll discuss common mistakes that make APIs confusing or difficult to use and how to avoid them. By the end of the session, attendees will have a deeper understanding of the art of API design and the tools to create interfaces that developers love.

Whether you’re an experienced library developer or just starting your journey, this talk will equip you with the knowledge to build APIs that not only work but shine.

description: Designing an API is more than just defining methods and parameters; it’s about creating a seamless connection between the user and the library. A well-crafted API can elevate the user experience, making a library a go-to choice for developers. But what separates a great API from a mediocre one? And what makes an API actively frustrating to use?

This talk explores the principles of effective API design—simplicity, consistency, and flexibility—and their real-world applications. Attendees will learn to identify common pitfalls in API design and how to avoid them. Through an iterative approach, we’ll work on improving a real-world API, transforming it from cumbersome to delightful. This process will highlight the importance of understanding your users’ needs and designing with empathy, ensuring that your API becomes a tool developers genuinely enjoy working with.

Whether you’re designing APIs for internal tools, open-source libraries, or enterprise systems, this session will provide actionable insights and practical techniques to help you craft APIs that stand out.
