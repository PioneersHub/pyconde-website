abstract: APIs serve as the critical interface between users and libraries, yet designing an effective API remains a nuanced and often underestimated challenge. In this talk, we’ll explore what makes an API great by focusing on three core principles: simplicity, consistency, and flexibility.

Through a hands-on case study, we’ll iteratively improve a real-world API, showcasing practical techniques for identifying and addressing pain points. Along the way, we’ll discuss common mistakes that make APIs confusing or difficult to use and how to avoid them. By the end of the session, attendees will have a deeper understanding of the art of API design and the tools to create interfaces that developers love.

Whether you’re an experienced library developer or just starting your journey, this talk will equip you with the knowledge to build APIs that not only work but shine.
