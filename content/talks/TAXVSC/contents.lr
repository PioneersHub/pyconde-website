abstract:

This fireside chat brings together leading voices from industry and open-source to explore how artificial intelligence is being meaningfully integrated into enterprise environments—beyond the buzzwords. Moderated by Alexander CS Hendorf, the conversation features Walid Mehanna (Chief Data Officer, Merck), Dr. Alexander Beck (CTO, Quoniam), and Ines Montani (co-founder explosion.ai, spaCy), who share their diverse perspectives from pharmaceuticals, finance, and AI tooling.

Together, they’ll explore the cultural, technical, and ethical dimensions of AI adoption in large organizations, the growing influence of open-source ecosystems, and the long-term vision required to build sustainable, human-centered AI systems. This session is designed for those who want to move past the hype and better understand what real-world innovation at scale looks like—and what it demands from leadership, infrastructure, and community.

full_description:

While headlines are dominated by generative AI breakthroughs and ever-larger models, some of the most meaningful progress is happening quietly—in enterprises that are aligning AI with long-term strategy and in open-source communities driving technical excellence. This session brings together Walid Mehanna (Chief Data Officer, Merck), Dr. Alexander Beck (CTO, Quoniam), and Ines Montani (co-founder of explosion.ai/spaCy) in a live conversation moderated by Alexander CS Hendorf.

Together, they’ll explore how open-source tools shape enterprise AI adoption, the cultural and organizational shifts needed to move beyond pilots and prototypes, and the responsibilities that come with deploying AI in production. From internal LLM platforms and research pipelines to industry collaboration and digital ethics, the panel will offer grounded, practical insights from vastly different domains.

This isn’t another panel about AI buzzwords. It’s a discussion about building AI systems that matter—tools that integrate with people, processes, and purpose. The audience can expect a thoughtful, forward-looking exchange between builders, strategists, and leaders who are working at the edge of what’s possible, while keeping a strong eye on what’s meaningful.
