abstract:

The reality of being a junior developer in 2025 means navigating the promise and pitfalls of AI-assisted development. Since the advent of ChatGPT, junior developers have been navigating a new landscape of AI-assisted programming. I've discovered the fine line between being a 0.1x and a 10x engineer. Here's my honest journey as a machine learning engineer, skeptically about LLM's. I discovered that becoming a "10x engineer" with GenAI isn't quite as advertised. This talk shares the reality of AI-assisted development, where every day brings either brilliant solutions or spectacular failures.

Since ChatGPT's release, I've mapped the fine line between becoming a more efficient developer and falling into the trap of AI dependency. This talk shares practical insights, workflows, and honest failures that helped me develop a balanced approach to AI-assisted development - from spectacular productivity wins to humbling debugging sessions of AI-generated "optimizations."  

This talk explores the practical reality of using GenAI tools in daily development workflows. We'll examine how initial expectations of instant expertise often clash with the actual learning curve, and how to transform this challenge into an opportunity for growth. Through real examples and live demonstrations, we'll explore:

* The evolution from basic code generation to strategic AI collaboration
* Establishing effective workflows that enhance rather than hinder productivity
* Common pitfalls and how to avoid them
* Key strategies for maintaining code quality while leveraging AI capabilities

The presentation focuses on practical, implementable approaches rather than theoretical possibilities. Attendees will learn how to integrate AI tools effectively into their development process while avoiding the trap of over-reliance. Whether you're skeptical about AI or eager to embrace it, this talk provides a realistic framework for using GenAI to enhance your development skills without compromising fundamental understanding.
