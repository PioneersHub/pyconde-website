description: AI agents are transforming the way we create applications. However, developing multi-agent applications can often feel complex and time-consuming. LangFlow, the leading Python-based and open-source visual editor for low-code AI applications with over 40k stars on GitHub, simplifies this process by offering an intuitive, easy-to-use interface for building AI-driven solutions.

In this talk, we will start by introducing the concept of AI agents—what they are, how they work, and why they’re important for modern applications. Then, we will dive into LangFlow, showcasing how its visual editor allows you to quickly create powerful AI applications without needing to write extensive code. Finally, we’ll bring everything together with a live demo, where we’ll build a multi-agent application from scratch, step by step.

By the end of the session, you’ll have a clear understanding of how LangFlow can help you build efficient, multi-agent AI systems with ease, and you'll be ready to start using it to create your own intelligent applications.
