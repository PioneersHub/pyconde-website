abstract: Two years after Chris Lattner unleashed Mojo on the tech world with promises of blazing speeds and Pythonic ease, it's time to assess its journey. In this talk, we revisit Mojo's initial claims, examine real-world performance gains, explore enhancements in language features, and analyze the growth of its ecosystem and community. Using our experience from developing a Large Language Model Interpretation library, we'll determine whether Mojo has solidified its place among AI development languages or if it still faces challenges against established contenders like Rust and Julia. Join us as we provide a comprehensive update on Mojoâ€™s achievements, setbacks, and future prospects in the rapidly evolving landscape of AI and machine learning.
