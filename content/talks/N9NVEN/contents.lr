abstract: With the advent of AI, LLMs have become more powerful and there are many Python libraries that help you to leverage these LLMs in your application. But because of the novelty of these libraries and the speed with which things are constantly changing in this domain, itâ€™s hard to get hold of things. In this talk we will discuss how to structure your Python application to use LLMs and configure them to use your proprietary data to answer questions, we will go through some common libraries like LlamaIndex and Langchain that help you to use LLMs efficiently and we will discuss some common problems that such applications can face.

description: In this talk, we will discuss primarily these topics which revolve around using LLMs in a Python project - 
1. Different LLMs and their current state
2. LlamaIndex and Langchain Python libraries
3. Using LlamaIndex for indexing your data
4. Langchain to connect all the AI agents
5. Integrating with a vector storage
6. Avoiding common pitfalls

The technical requirement of this talk is basic understanding of Python
