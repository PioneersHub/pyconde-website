abstract: Human dependency to make judgement calls is a critical part for most consumer facing businesses. This is slow, expensive and unreliable to some extent. What if LLMs can handle these judgement calls? Instead of making people do it, can we teach LLMs to understand the context, stick to the guidelines and make decisions which are similar to the quality of a human?
