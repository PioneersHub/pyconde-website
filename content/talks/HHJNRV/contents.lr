abstract:

Human dependency to make judgement calls is a critical part for most consumer facing businesses. This is slow, expensive and unreliable to some extent. What if LLMs can handle these judgement calls? Instead of making people do it, can we teach LLMs to understand the context, stick to the guidelines and make decisions which are similar to the quality of a human?

full_description:

The objective is to share our learnings while implementing different automations using python for businesses which helps them reduce the time to solve a particular problem and also reduce cost.

In this talk, you will learn:
- How to split complex workflows into clear action steps and decision steps.
- How LLMs can take over human judgment tasks like address verification.
- Best practices and pitfalls when using LLMs for automated decision-making.
- Ideas for future advancements in agent-based automation.

Some key points to discuss:
- We will be presenting our POC which we performed for a multinational company (without disclosing any names / PII data) for using LLMs as decision nodes and other automation techniques (vendor API for address information, headless browsing) to get better information
- LLMs could be tricky, with every new model, previous learnings might have to improve. So, our learning were majorly on openaiâ€™s 4o and 3.5-turbo models. They are also applicable with the 4o-mini models as well.
