abstract: As the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) continues to revolutionise manufacturing, energy, automotive and supply chain industries, the ability to predict future outcomes, detect anomalies and optimize operations is critical. The challenge of prediction in IIoT is collecting, consolidating and analysing high throughput time series data to detect patterns. By investing in Python with its time series libraries and tooling, manufacturing companies can benefit by improving operational efficiency and worker safety.
