abstract:

As the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) continues to revolutionise manufacturing, energy, automotive and supply chain industries, the ability to predict future outcomes, detect anomalies and optimize operations is critical. The challenge of prediction in IIoT is collecting, consolidating and analysing high throughput time series data to detect patterns. By investing in Python with its time series libraries and tooling, manufacturing companies can benefit by improving operational efficiency and worker safety.

full_description:

This session will be an introduction to working with time series data to enable predictive analytics and forecasting in IIoT by leveraging statistical and machine learning models. 

We will demystify time series data, common use cases and challenges in IIoT environments and go over why predictive models are crucial. Attendees will learn about the structure of sensor and IoT data in industrial settings, basic time series forecasting methods like Moving Averages, ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average), Exponential Smoothing and an overview of common ML models and evaluation metrics for predicting trends in time series data.
