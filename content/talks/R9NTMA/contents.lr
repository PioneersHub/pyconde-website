abstract:

I'm, as an award-winning engineering mentor and i work with many mentees from different countries, different genders and different cultural backgrounds. They are learning different programming languages and solving different problems.... but they all ask the same question that their studies or courses haven't answered.

Why we were not learned how to deal with this “fear against complexity”. And how to stop being scared.

full_description:

In my talk, I offer some suggestions on how you can deal with this “fear of complexity”. Although my advices are not a silver bullet, but they can really help:
I will cover several topics in my talk:
1. How to stay motivated: little obvious tricks.
2. The challenge of making the right choice. It doesn't matter what technology in what field you choose - it's the feeling of being right that matters.
3. Supporting sources. Something that can increase motivation and get sources of strength to keep going.
