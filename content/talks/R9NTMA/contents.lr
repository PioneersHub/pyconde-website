abstract: I'm, as an award-winning engineering mentor and i work with many mentees from different countries, different genders and different cultural backgrounds. They are learning different programming languages and solving different problems.... but they all ask the same question that their studies or courses haven't answered.

Why we were not learned how to deal with this “fear against complexity”. And how to stop being scared.
