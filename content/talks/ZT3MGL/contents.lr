abstract:

Roundnet is a dynamic and fast-growing sport that combines quick reaction, athleticism, and strong community. However, like many emerging sports, it faces challenges in balancing competition, optimizing rules, and increasing accessibility for both players and spectators. This is where Python and data analysis come into play.

In this talk, I'll share insights from my role as Data Lead on the International Roundnet rule committee, where we use Python-powered data analysis to make informed decisions about the future of the sport. We'll explore how analyzing gameplay patterns and testing rule changes with simulation can lead to fairer, more exciting games and attract a broader audience.

full_description:

Roundnet is a dynamic and fast-growing sport that combines quick reaction, athleticism, and strong community.  But what's truly unique about Roundnet is the opportunity it offers: as a new and emerging sport, we have the rare chance to shape its global rule changes entirely through data analysis. This is a groundbreaking approach – a first for any sport in the modern era.

In this talk, I’ll share insights from my role as Data Lead on the International Roundnet Rule Committee and take you through how we are leveraging Python and data analysis to guide these changes. Over the past year, we’ve collected rule proposals and have set up a series of experiments designed to test their effects. Using Python and statistical modeling, we’re planning to select key tournaments worldwide this year to observe how rule adjustments impact gameplay data.

Our ultimate goal is to discover if specific combinations of rule changes can make Roundnet fairer, more exciting, and accessible for players and spectators alike. This journey is an exploration of how data-driven decision-making can transform a sport from the ground up, using real-world insights and experimentation.

This talk will take you on the journey of how we set up our testing framework, what tools we’re using, and how we’ve employed Python-powered analysis to bring empirical evidence into the decision-making process. It will equip you with a new perspective on data's role in shaping real-world change – especially in grassroots movements, community building, and sports.
