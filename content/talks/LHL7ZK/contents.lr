abstract: Will the grand unified theory of physics be discovered by a human or an algorithm?
The next grand challenge AI is a completely autonomous scientific significant breakthrough. The development of an artificial curious scientist will revolutionize how humans approach discovering knowledge.

Large language models are ungrounded. They can only superficially reconstitute existing knowledge, they do not create new abstractions. Applying the scientific method and reasoning with evidence is the ultimate anti-hallucination, progress will push post-LLM development in AI forward.

This talk will cover why AI science is important and how we might get there.
