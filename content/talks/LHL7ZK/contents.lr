abstract:

Will the grand unified theory of physics be discovered by a human or an algorithm?
The next grand challenge AI is a completely autonomous scientific significant breakthrough. The development of an artificial curious scientist will revolutionize how humans approach discovering knowledge.

Large language models are ungrounded. They can only superficially reconstitute existing knowledge, they do not create new abstractions. Applying the scientific method and reasoning with evidence is the ultimate anti-hallucination, progress will push post-LLM development in AI forward.

This talk will cover why AI science is important and how we might get there.

full_description:

After AlphaGo, there has been a conspicuous absence of a "grand challenge" for AI; since then generative models have risen to prominence, two Nobel prizes have been awarded for work in AI. LLMs have passed the Turing test like a express train passing a small town station. What is the next mountain to climb? This talk proposed the next grand challenge AI is a completely autonomous scientific breakthrough. The first AI generated discovery that is regarded my numerous human experts as a significant breakthrough and produced with minimal human intervention. The promising fields for this development are mathematics and theoretical physics, especially the Clay Mathematics Institute's Millennium Prize Problems, or a serious contribution towards the grand unified theory of physics. However AI discoveries in other areas such as biology, materials science and neuroscience are also tantalizingly close.

The first AI scientific discovery requires pushing the limits of what is possible with today's technology.
Large language models are ungrounded. They can only superficially reconstitute existing knowledge; they cannot create new abstractions. Applying the scientific method and reasoning with evidence is the ultimate anti-hallucination, progress will push post-LLM development in AI forward. It will also demonstrate how generative models can move humanity forward, not just fill the internet up with slop. This challenge is an excellent intermediate step; it doesn't necessarily require super-intelligence or consciousness for success, sidestepping these philosophically fraught and possibly dangerous areas. While the success condition of acceptance by prominent human scientists is less specific than beating a human world champion at a game, it is still relatively well defined, compared to something more open to interpretation like artificial general intelligence.

The talk will justify AI science as the next great challenge, discuss the ways pursuing it will push AI research forward and outline possible promising approaches.
