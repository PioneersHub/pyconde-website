abstract:

Create, reflect, and earn—with purpose. In this workshop, you’ll not only build your own AI agent but also confront the ethical questions it raises, from its impact on jobs to its potential for social good. Together, we’ll explore how to harness AI for empowerment while uncovering pathways to turn your skills into meaningful value.

This workshop is designed to equip Python enthusiasts with the tools to create their own AI agent while fostering a deeper understanding of the societal implications of this technology. Through hands-on learning, collaborative discussions, and practical monetization strategies, you’ll leave with more than just code—you’ll gain a vision of how AI can be wielded responsibly and profitably.

The session unfolds in three engaging parts:
	1.	Build Your AI Agent
Start with the fundamentals of AI by designing and implementing a functional agent. Using Python, we’ll demystify the process and equip you with practical skills for creating an AI that responds to user needs and scenarios.
	2.	Reflect on Ethics and the Future of Work
Once your agent comes to life, we’ll pause to examine the bigger picture:
	•	How does the AI agent you have created may reshape the job market?
	•	Can it democratize and decentralize opportunities, or does it risk amplifying inequalities?
	•	What collective vision do we want for the future of work?
This thought-provoking discussion will challenge you to think critically about the role of technology in fostering empowerment or exacerbating social challenges.
	3.	Earn by Sharing Value
Finally, we’ll explore how your AI agent can create real-world value. You’ll learn how to leverage marketplaces like OpenServ to turn your innovation into income. Whether you aim to solve practical problems, inspire creativity, or contribute to ethical AI development, this segment will connect your skills with opportunities for meaningful impact.

By the end of the workshop, you’ll have built an AI agent, grappled with its ethical dimensions, and uncovered how to use your coding prowess to create and share value—all while shaping a more inclusive, responsible AI ecosystem.
