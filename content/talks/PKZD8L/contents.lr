abstract: Create, reflect, and earn—with purpose. In this workshop, you’ll not only build your own AI agent but also confront the ethical questions it raises, from its impact on jobs to its potential for social good. Together, we’ll explore how to harness AI for empowerment while uncovering pathways to turn your skills into meaningful value.

This workshop is designed to equip Python enthusiasts with the tools to create their own AI agent while fostering a deeper understanding of the societal implications of this technology. Through hands-on learning, collaborative discussions, and practical monetization strategies, you’ll leave with more than just code—you’ll gain a vision of how AI can be wielded responsibly and profitably.
