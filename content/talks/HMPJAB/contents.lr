description: Introduction:
The session kicks off by contextualizing the need for a migration strategy, exploring the challenges of migrating an extensive product database with a time constraint. It establishes the imperative of achieving zero downtime during the migration process and introduces Blue-Green Deployment as the chosen methodology.

Why Blue-Green Deployment?
The presentation will elucidate why Blue-Green Deployment is the chosen strategy, emphasizing its ability to facilitate continuous delivery, eliminate downtime, and ensure a seamless transition between the old and new systems. The approach's agility and efficiency in managing a large-scale migration will be highlighted.

Challenges Addressed:
Delving into the challenges encountered during the migration of over 300,000 products, the presentation will discuss issues such as scalability, independent task execution, migration progress monitoring, and the need for a swift and easy rollback mechanism.

Migration Strategies:
Two pivotal aspects of the migration process will be explored in detail. Firstly, the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process, and secondly, the Blue-Green Deployment methodology. The intricacies of both strategies and their synergy in achieving a zero downtime migration will be thoroughly examined.

Non-functional Requirements:
The heart of the presentation revolves around the non-functional requirements imperative for a successful migration. These include the ability to scale, task independence, migration progress monitoring, restart from failure, fast and easy rollback, and the core element of a zero downtime migration strategy. The emphasis will be on the significance of error monitoring and the ability to react swiftly to mitigate risks.

Infrastructure Solution:
The session will conclude by shedding light on the chosen infrastructure to meet the non-functional requirements. The selected infrastructure will be unveiled as the linchpin in ensuring scalability, independence of tasks, robust progress monitoring, and swift error resolution.
Attendees will leave with a comprehensive understanding of the critical role played by Blue-Green Deployment in meeting the outlined non-functional requirements, and the strategic choice of infrastructure for a seamless, fast, and scalable migration of an extensive product database.
