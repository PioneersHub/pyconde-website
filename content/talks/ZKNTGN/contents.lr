abstract: This talk introduces a novel Python library for statistical testing using e-values, offering a refreshing alternative to traditional p-values. We'll explore how this approach enables real-time sequential testing, allowing data scientists to monitor experiments continuously without the statistical penalties of repeated testing. Through practical examples, we'll demonstrate how e-values provide more intuitive evidence measures and enable flexible stopping rules in A/B testing, clinical trials, and anomaly detection. The library implements cutting-edge methods from game-theoretic probability, making advanced sequential testing accessible to Python practitioners. Whether you're conducting A/B tests, monitoring production models, or running clinical trials, this talk will equip you with powerful new tools for sequential data analysis.
