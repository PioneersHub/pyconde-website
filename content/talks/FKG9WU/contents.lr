**Atomic Habits Bot: Build a Habit in 66 Days**  

Forming new habits can be challenging, but technology can simplify the process. In this talk, you will learn how to build an **Atomic Habits Bot** using **Python**, **Langchain**, **LLMs**, and the **Telegram API** to send personalized notifications via Telegram. Inspired by James Clear's *Atomic Habits*, this bot will guide users through the principles of habit formation, helping them develop a new habit in 66 days.  

By leveraging **LLMs** and vectorization, the bot provides tailored interactions based on user progress. Additionally, **Langchain** is used to connect language models with external platforms, creating a seamless user experience. This session will combine psychology, coding, and AI to demonstrate how technology can help individuals stay consistent in their habit-building journey.
