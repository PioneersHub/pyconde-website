### Abstract  

**Atomic Habits Bot: Build a Habit in 66 Days**  

Forming new habits can be challenging, but technology can simplify the process. In this talk, you will learn how to build an **Atomic Habits Bot** using **Python**, **Langchain**, **LLMs**, and the **Telegram API** to send personalized notifications via Telegram. Inspired by James Clear's *Atomic Habits*, this bot will guide users through the principles of habit formation, helping them develop a new habit in 66 days.  

By leveraging **LLMs** and vectorization, the bot provides tailored interactions based on user progress. Additionally, **Langchain** is used to connect language models with external platforms, creating a seamless user experience. This session will combine psychology, coding, and AI to demonstrate how technology can help individuals stay consistent in their habit-building journey.

### Description  

Building habits is essential for personal growth, but sticking to them can often feel overwhelming. This session introduces the **Atomic Habits Bot**, a Python-powered chatbot designed to help users form habits effectively by integrating James Clear's *Atomic Habits* principles.  

The bot utilizes advanced AI tools, including **LLMs** (such as GPT-3 or GPT-4) for personalized interactions and **Langchain** to create dynamic integrations with external platforms. Through the **Telegram API**, the bot sends automated reminders and motivational messages, adapting to the user’s progress over the 66-day habit formation period.  

This talk covers:  
1. **Psychology of Habits**: An overview of *Atomic Habits* principles and their real-world applications.  
2. **Role of LLMs**: How large language models generate natural, personalized conversations.  
3. **Bot Construction**: Step-by-step guide to building the bot using Python and Langchain.  
4. **Telegram Integration**: Connecting the bot to Telegram for real-time notifications.  
5. **Live Demonstration**: A live showcase of the bot’s functionality and features.  

By the end of the session, attendees will be inspired and equipped to combine Python and AI tools to develop their own habit-building applications.
