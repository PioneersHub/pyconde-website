### Anastasia Karavdina

My background is particle physics, where I was completely spoiled by access to large amounts of data and the freedom to try out every hot ML algorithm on it. The experiments I participated in were so-called large scale experiments (e.g Large Hadron Collider) and had from 500+ up to 2.5k other people working on them. So in addition to physics, I was exposed to the best software development practices that helped us to avoid a complete mess and destroy the Universe. 

Afterwards I was working as Data Scientist in various fields and recently became "Solution Architect ML/AI and BI" at big enterprise company. 

During my free time, I like learning new tools and techniques and implementing them in end-to-end AI/ML and IoT projects. My experience has also been very helpful in guiding data analysts, data scientists, and machine learning engineers as a mentor and contributing to the growth of the next generation of data scientist elite.

Mentorship is a rewarding journey that allows experienced professionals to guide and empower the next generation of talent. As a mentor in the data field, I have had the privilege of helping individuals navigate their careers, refine their skills, and unlock their potential. In this talk, I will share my personal journey into becoming a professional mentor, how I approach mentorship in a structured and impactful way, and the unique value a mentorship brings to both mentees and mentors.

I’ll provide insights into the day-to-day activities of mentoring, from offering career guidance to solving technical challenges, while also discussing the importance of tailoring advice to individual goals. Beyond technical skills, mentorship fosters confidence, networking, and long-term growth for mentees while offering mentors opportunities for personal development, deep satisfaction, and a broader industry perspective.

With the rapid evolution of the data industry, mentorship has never been more critical. This talk will highlight how professionals at any stage of their career can engage in mentorship to create a ripple effect of positive change in the data community—and why taking the step to become a mentor, paid or otherwise, is an investment in the future of data science and yourself.
