abstract:

Because of the obstruction sciences and learning disorders, and as we know, there are a lot of limitations for women to learn because of gender discrimination, which is common in today's world.Education and learning have turned into a challenge for learners and teachers. So I developed a program in Jupyter Notebook based on Python language and its libraries, such as Numpy, Matplotlib,ipywidget, and Ipython, also some machine learning libraries such as sklearn to visualize the process of solution of mathematical data from beginners to advanced learners.So the program uses Jupyter Notebook to make the process of learning understandable and easier.
You can fully explore the code and mentioned project in the below GitHub repository named JupyterDataViz includes whole codes of  the project:

The above mentioned program is a base step of a startup, including an online platform whose founder is me, and it visualizes more mathematics data.it's submitted to PtyCon US2025. You can explore the mentioned startup at https://github.com/VizAI-
platform/Visualization-Of-Mathematic
All in all, I want to dedicate this program to women and girls who faced problems in education due to gender discrimination and were forbidden from learning and education. We hope that in addition to facilitating learning, it will also be a step toward solving the problem of these struggling girls and women.

full_description:

Objective: The project was designed to help students learn through the visualization of theoretical mathematics. This project provides visual answers for issues in theoretical mathematics. All learners can input the necessary data into the programs to view the results visually. Moreover, students are given visual solutions to mathematical problems.
Target Audience: Students who are engaged in mathematical issues and anyone who wants to learn and teach are the audience for this project.
All in all, by introducing this Jupyter Notebook file, which includes programs built on the Python programming language, we can visualize theoretical mathematical problems and give students an opportunity to understand math problems.
So this program has visualized the mathematical data. For example, you can enter some numbers as inputs to see the visualization solutions of mathematical calculations in colored charts, graphs, and geometric shapes. For more information, you can see the answer to the square root of perfect numbers in geometric shapes and solve the problem of the square root of imperfect numbers by deep learning g and see answers in the unit circle in trigonometry.
You can fully explore the code and mentioned project in the below GitHub repository which includes whole codes of  the project in GitHub repository named JupyterDataViz includes whole codes of  the project:

Also, because of the infinity of mathematics science, we are developing an app to upgrade the visualization of theoretical mathematics science.
The perspective of visualization mathematics Jupyter Notebook file is developing a Python web based app which makes the accessibility to my codes that have visualized the mathematical data much easier for students and others.
So the mentioned Jupyter Notebook file which visualizes the mathematical data, is the base level in developing a web based startup. The mentioned startup, which includes the web based app visualization of mathematical data, has been introduced in Pycon US 2025. However, it is the first time that the Jupyter Notebook file of visualization mathematical data has been presented as the basic core of the above mentioned startup. Moreover, the core idea and all codes of the Jupyter Notebook file were developed by me, and the startup, which was introduced in Pycon US 2025, is being further developed in collaboration with my colleague. For more information, you can check the bellow GitHub links.

Tools:
All of the codes is written in Python language using Jupyter Notebook.
Numpy, Matplotlib, ipywidget, and Ipython.Also, some machine learning  libraries, such as sklearn  to visualize the solution of mathematical problems which does not have absolute answers, such as mathematical solutions include imperfect numbers.
For the last point, one of the main goals is helping all brave women who are eager to learn but have been denied the right to education due to gender discrimination by providing them with easy access to learning. So we dedicate this platform to all brave women. We also hope it will be a step to solve their problems.
