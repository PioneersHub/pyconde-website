abstract: You don't need to be a manager to level up the skills of your team and other teams. Python Guilds offer a powerful way for organisations to turn passive knowledge sharing into active skill-building. But just having regular meetings together isn't enough. I've seen teams really accelerate when we were sharing code. This demands a safe environment where people feel comfortable sharing mistakes and learning from them. This presentation is about my experiences with founding a Python guild and how we got to a higher level of Python and PySpark skills together.
