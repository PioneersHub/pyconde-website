abstract: You don't need to be a manager to level up the skills of your team and other teams. Python Guilds offer a powerful way for organisations to turn passive knowledge sharing into active skill-building. But just having regular meetings together isn't enough. I've seen teams really accelerate when we were sharing code. This demands a safe environment where people feel comfortable sharing mistakes and learning from them. This presentation is about my experiences with founding a Python guild and how we got to a higher level of Python and PySpark skills together.

description: It all started three years ago when Python and PySpark began gaining popularity at my workplace. I noticed significant differences in the skill levels across teams. Some teams were highly experienced, while others were eager to get started but didn’t quite know how. That’s when I proposed starting a Python and PySpark guild — and so began an incredible journey.
Bringing developers together was a solid first step. People shared their screens, showcasing how they used VS Code, created Dockerized Python solutions, and tackled other technical challenges. However, it became clear that not every team could replicate these solutions. While anyone can start writing Python, mastering concepts like virtual environments, testing, and logging required deeper understanding. It didn’t help that experienced and inexperienced developers often spoke different "technical languages."
The urgency for action became even clearer as the organization’s reliance on Python grew. Two major new customers brought in a flood of work, increasing the need for developer maturity. Recognizing this, I decided to try a different approach: I organized a shared coding session. In this session, less experienced teams worked together to create a PySpark program, with experienced developers present to offer guidance and feedback.
That approach made a big difference. Gaps in knowledge became immediately visible, and experienced developers started creating solutions that made it easier for less experienced teams to get started. This shift sparked a culture of collaboration and continuous improvement.
And the best part? I’m not a manager, scrum master, or team lead. I’m a senior data engineer. But you don’t need to be a manager to start a guild and help teams level up together.
