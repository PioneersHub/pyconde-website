abstract:

Can you imagine a python project without any return? 
Is it overhead or memory saving? Is it complicated or would it reduce complexity? Is it testable or a horror for unittesting?

The general idea of this talk is: to effectively use generators in code, we need to change our programming style, and it's not too easy, but it's possible. During my talk I will convert functions and methods from the project into generators, and we will see what is effective, what is not, and where it is still better to use returns.

full_description:

This talk is a quintessence of experience in python projects built exclusively on generators. Generators don't speed up the project directly, but they open up the possibility of lazy data processing, which in turn reduces memory consumption and can improve the performance of the project in general. Thanks to changes in recent versions of Python, the advantages of generators over common functions are becoming significant in every modern high-load data consumption project.
