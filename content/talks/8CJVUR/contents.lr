abstract: Can you imagine a python project without any return? 
Is it overhead or memory saving? Is it complicated or would it reduce complexity? Is it testable or a horror for unittesting?

The general idea of this talk is: to effectively use generators in code, we need to change our programming style, and it's not too easy, but it's possible. During my talk I will convert functions and methods from the project into generators, and we will see what is effective, what is not, and where it is still better to use returns.
