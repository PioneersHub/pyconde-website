abstract: Box2D is a widely-used physics engine that powers many games, simulations, and can be used as educational tools. However, the existing Python bindings are outdated and unmaintained for many years.
In this talk we present  novel python bindings for Box2D based on nanobind and show how these allow to create tiny 2D physics simulation and games with a minimal amount of boilderplate code.

description: Box2D is a widely-used physics engine that powers many games, simulations, and can be used as educational tools.  Box2D is written in C but bindings for many other languages and frameworks exist.
However, the existing Python bindings are outdated and unmaintained for many years.
In this talk we present  novel python bindings for Box2D based on nanobind and show how these allow to create tiny 2D physics simulation and games with a minimal amount of code. Developing  such simulations or tiny physics-based games is a great way to motivate and teach programming to kinds and students.  Using Box2D from Python allows students and users to focus on problem-solving without the complexity of compiled languages like C/C++.
We show how games like "AngryBirds", "WorldOfGoo"  and others can be implemented with a few lines of python code.
