full_description:

The rapid growth of web data and its widespread use in the labour market has resulted in an increased need for innovative approaches to analyse and understand job postings. In recent years, generative artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising tool for web data analysis. We will present our exploration of the potential of generative AI for web job postings analysis. We will discuss different models and applications such as word-embedding, skills similarity, skills description generation and improvement, and others. This research will provide insights into the benefits and limitations of generative AI in this domain. The first presentation of this research was presented at WIH-CONF (Eurostat) 2023.
