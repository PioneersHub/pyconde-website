abstract:

Data2Text is a Natural Language Generation task, in which a specific domain of texts is generated faithfully based on given, structural data. The talk discusses a Proof of Concept project, in which LLMs were utilized to generate game reports for a German first division football team. It covers the necessary steps for building such a system and the problems and performances which can be expected from similar systems.

full_description:

Data2Text is a Natural Language Generation task, in which a specific domain of texts is generated faithfully based on given, structural data. The talk discusses a Proof of Concept project, in which LLMs were utilized to generate game reports for a German first division football team.

We go through the necessary preparation steps for conducting the project, regarding annotation, aligning and filtering of text and data.
The proposed system is a hybrid of historical NLG pipeline components and big LLMs with strong, linguistic capabilities. We discuss the data-dependent difficulties for selecting and ordering the tabular content. When evaluating the capabilities of the Llama3 model series, we compare different techniques, such as in-context few-shot learning of a larger model vs. fine-tuning of smaller models. For evaluating the final results, we show multiple unsupervised metrics, LLM-as-a-judge systems and compare them with human annotations.

Finally, we summarize the lessons learned from the project and discuss possible future steps for a productive version.
