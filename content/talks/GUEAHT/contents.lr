abstract: In natural disaster scenarios, reliable communication is crucial. This talk presents a solution for disaster relief coordination using OpenStreetMap vector maps hosted on a local device in the emergency vehicle with FastAPI, ensuring functionality without an internet connection. By integrating a database of post codes and street names, and leveraging a LORAWAN gateway to receive positional data and water levels, this system ensures access to critical information even in blackout situations.
