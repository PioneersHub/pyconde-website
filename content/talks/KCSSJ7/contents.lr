abstract:

Ever wondered how to build an AI agent to enable self-service analytics through prompting? In this talk, I will share my experience of building a multi-tenant conversational analytics set-up built into a SaaS platform. This talk is intended for AI engineers, data scientists, software engineers and anyone interested in building AI agents to power conversational analytics using open-source tools. 

I will discuss the challenges faced in designing and implementing this framework, as well as the lessons learned along the way. We'll answer questions such as, why offer analytics through prompting? Why go for open source? How to deal with multi-tenancy? How to build it into an existing product? What are the implications for the analytics field?

full_description:

This talk will start by answering the question: What is conversational analytics and how does it work? After which we'll dive into how this implementation was done. 

* How analytics in SaaS can be fundamentally improved by conversational analytics (5 mins). 
* How the Text-to-SQL architecture was shaped using Langchain, pgvector and Vanna.AI (5 mins). 
* Dealing with multi-tenancy in PostgreSQL and BigQuery to ensure data security (5 mins). 
* How to handle tenant specific pre-training and training examples (5 mins). 
* Building this into an existing application and demo (5 minutes). 
* Implications for the field of analytics (5 mins). 

In the end you should have a good idea on why conversational analytics can be a game changer, what the pitfalls are and how to build it with open source technologies.
