abstract: Imagine a world where AI systems perpetuate biases, exacerbate inequalities, and undermine trust.
Well, you can stop 'imagining' because it WILL happen if we are not careful while developing such systems. AI technology is full of biases, unfairness, and socio-technical problems that can have unexpected results if not understood properly. The consequences are dire, and so, it is high time that we incorporate fairness techniques in our systems to build a conscious new world of 'fair' technology.

Join me on a journey to explore the nuances of fairness constraints, or "shades of fairness", that can make or break an AI system's integrity. There is NO one-way-fits-all to make an AI system fair.

Together, let's build a 'fair' world where AI empowers and uplifts humanity towards a progressive future!
