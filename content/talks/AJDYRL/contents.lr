abstract: Every Python developer faces performance challenges, from slow data processing to memory-intensive operations. While external libraries like Numba or Cython offer solutions, understanding core Python optimization techniques is crucial for writing efficient code. This talk explores practical optimization strategies using Python's built-in capabilities, demonstrating how to achieve significant performance improvements without external dependencies. Through real-world examples from machine learning pipelines and data processing applications, we'll examine common bottlenecks and their solutions. Whether you're building data pipelines, web applications, or ML systems, these techniques will help you write faster, more efficient Python code.
