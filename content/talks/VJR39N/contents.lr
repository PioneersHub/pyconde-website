abstract: The development of open source software is increasingly recognized as a critical contribution across many disciplines, yet the mechanisms for credit and citation vary significantly. This talk uses astronomy as a case study to explore shared challenges in attributing software contributions across research and industry. It will review the evolution of journal recommendations and policies over the past decade, alongside emerging publishing practices offering insights into their impact on the recognition of software contributions. An analysis of citation patterns for widely used libraries (numpy, scipy, astropy) highlights trends over time and their dependence on publication venues and policies. The talk will conclude with strategies for both developers and users for improving the recognition of software, fostering collaboration and sustainability in software ecosystems. All data and analysis code will be made available in a public repository, supporting transparency and further study.
