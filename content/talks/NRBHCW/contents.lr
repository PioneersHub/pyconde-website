abstract:

Most of us are familiar with the line `def foo(...):`, it's a function declaration. But have you ever wondered about the full story behind these `...`? There is much more to it than just handling positional and keyword arguments.

In this talk, we will dive deeper into the secrets of Functional Arguments, starting right from the fundamentals, `*args`, `**kwargs` to `type hinting` and `generics`. Expect a good mix of practical examples and anecdotes, on how to leverage `Args` effectively to create intuitive interfaces, and learn to write clean APIs

full_description:

At first glance, Python’s function arguments seem quite straightforward - just positional and keyword arguments, right? But this is just the tip, there is much beneath the surface.

In this talk, we will dive deeper into depths of what Python’s argument system has to offer. Along the way, we’ll dive into practical examples that showcase how mastering these nuances can lead to cleaner, more intuitive APIs and smarter design choices.

This talk will:

* Highlight overlooked aspects of Python’s functional arguments.
* Introduce techniques to make APIs both robust like type hinting
* Share best practices to avoid subtle yet impactful mistakes

By the end of this talk, listeners will have a deep understanding of Python’s functional argument system, including how to use type annotations, generics, and argument restrictions to design intuitive and Pythonic interfaces. 

Join us to go beyond the basics and uncover what's so Pythonic about Python's functional arguments.
