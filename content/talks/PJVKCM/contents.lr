abstract: Every line of code has an environmental cost. In this talk, attendees will understand how to measure and optimize your Python applications' energy consumption using tools you already know. We'll combine familiar libraries like pandas and scikit-learn with monitoring tools to create a complete picture of your code's carbon footprint â€“ from database queries to ML model inference. Through practical examples, you'll learn how different implementation choices affect energy usage and how to make your code more environmentally friendly without sacrificing performance.
