abstract:

Every line of code has an environmental cost. In this talk, attendees will understand how to measure and optimize your Python applications' energy consumption using tools you already know. We'll combine familiar libraries like pandas and scikit-learn with monitoring tools to create a complete picture of your code's carbon footprint – from database queries to ML model inference. Through practical examples, you'll learn how different implementation choices affect energy usage and how to make your code more environmentally friendly without sacrificing performance.

full_description:

In today's digital age, our code's environmental impact often goes unnoticed. This talk sheds light on how Python applications affect energy consumption and what we can do about it. From AI training to web services, digital infrastructure accounts for a significant portion of global energy usage – but it doesn't have to be this way. Through practical demonstrations, attendees will explore how different Python implementations affect power consumption and learn to make environmentally conscious coding decisions.

We'll dive into how seemingly innocent code choices can significantly impact carbon emissions, from database queries to ML model training. You'll see real-time monitoring of environmental impact in action and discover predictive approaches to estimate carbon footprints of different architectural choices. By examining patterns in computational resource usage and their energy implications, we'll uncover simple yet effective strategies to make Python applications more sustainable.
