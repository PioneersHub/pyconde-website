abstract: As the scale of data continues to grow exponentially, efficient data querying has become a critical challenge for mega-services and large-scale institutions. Traditional querying methods often fall short when faced with the sheer volume of data and the need for real-time responses. This is where Bloom Filters, a probabilistic data structure, shine by dramatically improving query performance and reducing resource overhead.

This talk will introduce Bloom Filters, explore their internal mechanics, and discuss their practical applications in large-scale systems. Through real-world examples and case studies, attendees will learn how some of the largest institutions in the world utilize Bloom Filters to handle billions of queries efficiently, maintain scalability, and optimize system performance.
