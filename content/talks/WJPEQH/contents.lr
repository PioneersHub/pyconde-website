abstract: Whenever you use a dot in Python you access an attribute.
While this seems a very simple operation,
behind the scenes many things can happen.
This tutorial looks into this mechanism that is regulated by descriptors.
You will learn how a descriptor works and what kind of problems it can help to
solve.
Python properties are based on descriptors and solve one type of problems.
Descriptors are more general, allow more use cases, and are more re-usable.
Descriptors are an advanced topic.
But once mastered, they provide a powerful tool to hide potentially complex
behavior behind a simple dot.
