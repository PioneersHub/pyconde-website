abstract: Construction work in national railroad networks often disrupts train traffic, making it vital to estimate hourly train numbers for effective re-routing. Traditionally managed by humans, this process has been automated due to staff shortages and demographic changes. DB Systel GmbH, Deutsche Bahn's IT provider, leveraged machine learning and artificial intelligence to estimate train traffic during construction. Using Python and frameworks like Pandas, scikit-learn, NumPy, PyTorch and Polars, their solution demonstrated significant benefits in performance and efficiency.
