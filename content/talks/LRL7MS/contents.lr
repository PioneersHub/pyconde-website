abstract: Open source thrives not just on code, but on the diverse perspectives and inclusive practices that shape our communities. In this dynamic talk, we explore the intersection of open source and diversity, shedding light on how to bridge existing gaps and build welcoming environments for underrepresented groups. Through real-world examples, practical strategies, and inspiring stories from existing researches made on African communities, we'll uncover the immense benefits of diversity and equip you with actionable steps to foster inclusivity. Join us to learn how you can help create a more vibrant and inclusive open-source community that goes beyond code.
