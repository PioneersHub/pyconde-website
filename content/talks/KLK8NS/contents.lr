abstract: This talk explores the journey of creating a Python microframework, guided by the DRY principle (Dont Repeat Yourself). It delves into the project's lifecycle, from identifying boilerplate code across multiple projects to designing, implementing and publishign the framework. The presentation examines challenges encountered and focus on how existing frameworks like Django, Flask, and FastAPI influenced the process.  It would focus on the value of analyzing existing frameworks and think beyon just blindly using them, but instead get inspired to create their own tools and solutions for everyday tasks.
