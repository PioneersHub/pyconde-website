abstract:

This talk explores the journey of creating a Python microframework, guided by the DRY principle (Dont Repeat Yourself). It delves into the project's lifecycle, from identifying boilerplate code across multiple projects to designing, implementing and publishign the framework. The presentation examines challenges encountered and focus on how existing frameworks like Django, Flask, and FastAPI influenced the process.  It would focus on the value of analyzing existing frameworks and think beyon just blindly using them, but instead get inspired to create their own tools and solutions for everyday tasks.

full_description:

The outline of the presentation would be the following:
1. Introduction
2. Problem Analysis (motivation, examples of boilerplate code, problem analysis)
3. Design and Development Process (initial steps, inspiration from existing frameworks like Django, Flask, FastAPI)
4. Challenges and Solutions (leassons learned from existing frameworks)
5. theTrial
6. Examples (how theTrial solved the initial problem)
7. Conclusion (Why it matters to go beyond just using libraries and frameworks passively)
 
This talk starts with boilerplate code commonly used across multiple microservices that need to connect with Kafka and concludes with theTrial, a microframework that simplifies Kafka communication. theTrial is built on top of Confluent-Kafka.
