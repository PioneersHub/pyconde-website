### Xia He-Bleinagel

Head of Data & Cloud, focused on inclusive career development, internal data science community, and creating diverse, high-performing data organization.

abstract:

Building inclusive data teams and sustainable career paths is a challenge many organizations struggle with—especially in fast-growing, highly technical environments. Data careers are often portrayed as linear, while diversity initiatives remain abstract or ineffective in practice.

This talk shares concrete, experience-based lessons from building an inclusive data organization that supports career growth, fosters an internal data science community, and achieved more than 50% women representation in data roles. Rather than focusing on theory, the session highlights practical decisions, structural changes, and leadership behaviors that made inclusion measurable and sustainable.

Attendees will gain actionable insights into designing career paths that support non-linear journeys, creating internal data communities that encourage learning and collaboration, and implementing diversity practices that strengthen—rather than dilute—technical excellence. The talk is relevant for data scientists, engineers, team leads, and managers who want to build better teams and healthier data cultures.

full_description:

Many organizations aim to grow strong data teams, yet struggle with three connected challenges: unclear career paths, weak internal data communities, and a lack of diversity—especially in senior and technical roles. These challenges are often treated separately, even though they strongly influence one another.

This talk presents a holistic approach to building an inclusive data organization by aligning career development, community building, and diversity goals. The focus is on practical actions and structural choices that can be applied in real-world settings, regardless of company size or industry.

Talk Outline
1. The problem: why data organizations struggle
- Common myths about data careers (linear paths, constant availability, narrow profiles)
- Why diversity efforts often fail in technical teams
- The cost of ignoring community and inclusion: attrition, silos, burnout, and missed talent

2. Career growth beyond linear paths
- Designing career paths that support different life phases and backgrounds
- Recognizing and valuing transferable skills in data roles
- Making progression criteria transparent and fair
- Supporting growth from individual contributor to leadership without forcing a single model

3. Building an internal data science community
- Why internal communities matter for learning, retention, and impact
- Creating spaces for knowledge sharing without gatekeeping
- Encouraging collaboration across roles (data science, engineering, analytics)
- Aligning community activities with business value and technical standards

4. Achieving diversity with intention
- What “50% women in data” actually requires in practice
- Hiring processes that reduce bias while maintaining technical excellence
- Inclusive team structures and ways of working
- Leadership behaviors that support inclusion without tokenism

5. What worked—and what didn’t
- Trade-offs, challenges, and lessons learned
- Why inclusion is a continuous process, not a one-time initiative

6. Actionable takeaways
- Practical steps attendees can apply in their own teams
- Signals to look for when inclusion efforts are working—or failing
- How to start small and scale impact over time
