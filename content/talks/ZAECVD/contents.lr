This presentation introduces emscripten-forge, a novel package distribution and manager designed to bring the power of the open source scientific computing stack to WebAssembly. It opens new possibilities for web-based scientific applications with an incredibly seamless and efficient user experience.

Emscripten-forge is built around Emscripten to cross-compile C/C++ code to WebAssembly. This allows developers to package a wide range of scientific computing tools for the Web. Similar to classic package managers, emscripten-forge provides in-browser compute environments composed of these readily usable scientific computing packages. At the moment, it supports Python, R, and C/C++ packages, as well as a C++ interpreter powered by LLVM. Access to these environments is facilitated by JupyterLite, which serves as a user interface to an interactive, user-friendly and highly configurable platform for scientific computing running entirely in the browser.

With Emscripten-forge, in-browser scientific computing becomes available for everyone, in other words, sharing of complex computations and even large applications can be done with a simple link. This drastically simplifies existing workflows and opens up a whole range of new possibilities for collaboration.
