abstract: The geometries in GeoPandas, using the Shapely library, are assumed to be in projected coordinates on a flat plane. While this approximation is often just fine, for global data this runs into its limitations. This presentation introduces spherely, a Python library for working with vector geometries on the sphere, and its integration into GeoPandas.
