### Danica Fine

Danica began her career as a software engineer in data visualization and warehousing with a business intelligence team where she served as a point-person for standards and best practices in data visualization across her company. In 2018, Danica moved to San Francisco and pivoted to backend engineering with a derivatives data team which was responsible for building and maintaining the infrastructure that processes millions of financial market data per second in near real-time. Her first project on this team involved Kafka Streams and Kafka Connect. From there, she immersed herself in the world of data streaming and found herself quite at home in the Apache Kafka and Apache Flink communities. She now leads the open source advocacy efforts at Snowflake, supporting Apache Iceberg and Apache Polaris (incubating). Outside of work, Danica is passionate about sustainability, increasing diversity in the technical community, and keeping her many houseplants alive. She can be found on X (Bluesky and Mastodon), talking about tech, plants, and baking @TheDanicaFine.

abstract:

Learn how to build a custom On-Air sign using Apache Kafka®, Apache Flink®, and Apache Iceberg™! See how to capture events like Zoom meetings and camera usage with Python, process data with FlinkSQL, analyze trends using Iceberg, and bring it all together with a practical IoT project that easily scales out.

full_description:

While many of us have adapted to work from home life, one major problem remains: finding an easy way to keep folks in your home away from your workspace when you’re on an important call. Dust off your Raspberry Pi––let’s build a custom on-air sign with Apache Kafka®, Apache Flink®, and Apache Iceberg™!

We’ll begin by writing Python scripts to capture key events––such as when a Zoom meeting is running and when a camera is being used––and produce it into Kafka. The live data are then consumed by a Raspberry Pi script to drive the operation of a custom designed on-air sign. From there, you’ll be introduced to the ins and outs of FlinkSQL for stream processing as we wrangle the data into a better format for downstream use. And, finally, we’ll see Iceberg in action and learn how to use query engines to analyze meeting and recording trends.

By the end of the session, you’ll be well-acquainted with this powerful trio of open source technologies and know how you could use the same scaffolding and scale out a simple, at-home project to millions of users and simultaneous events.
