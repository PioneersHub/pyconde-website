abstract: We all love Python - but we especially love it for its unique ability as a glue language.

In this talk we will show a number of ways of extending Python: using Rust, C and Cython, C++, CUDA and Mojo! We will use the pixi package manager and the open source conda-forge distribution to demonstrate how to easily build custom Python extensions with these languages.

The main challenge with custom extensions is about distributing them. The new pixi build feature makes it easy to build a Python extension into a conda package as well as wheel file for PyPI.

Pixi will manage not only Python, but also the compilers and other system-level dependencies.
