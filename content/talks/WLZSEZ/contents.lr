abstract: Accessible documentation benefits everyone, from developers to end users. Using the [PyData Sphinx Theme](https://pydata-sphinx-theme.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) as a case study, this talk dives into common accessibility barriers in documentation websites like low contrast colors, missing focus states, etc. and practical ways to address them. Learn about accessibility improvements and take part in a live accessibility audit to see how small changes can make a big difference.
