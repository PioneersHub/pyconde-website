abstract:

Accessible documentation benefits everyone, from developers to end users. Using the [PyData Sphinx Theme](https://pydata-sphinx-theme.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) as a case study, this talk dives into common accessibility barriers in documentation websites like low contrast colors, missing focus states, etc. and practical ways to address them. Learn about accessibility improvements and take part in a live accessibility audit to see how small changes can make a big difference.

full_description:

The Beatles told us that ‘all you need is love’ and while that is a lovely sentiment, love alone won’t fix low contrast colours, missing focus states or inaccessible navigation. These barriers impact countless users with disabilities, reducing the usefulness and reach of valuable documentation. So, while love is great, accessible docs are *essential*.

In this talk, we will use the [PyData Sphinx Theme](https://pydata-sphinx-theme.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) as a case study to explore common accessibility problems in documentation websites and how to tackle them. We will discuss the accessibility changes we made to the theme, how those changes affected users, and what we learnt along the way. Additionally, we will also conduct a short accessibility audit on a website suggested by the audience. This demo will provide a practical understanding of how to improve accessibility.

Whether you’re a documentation maintainer, a curious developer or simply someone who cares about accessibility, this beginner-friendly talk will help you learn more about accessibility in documentation and how to get started. Love might be a universal language, but your code appreciates accessible documentation.
