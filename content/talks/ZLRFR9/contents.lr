### Eduard Thamm

Eduard is a technical leader with a background in distributed systems, platform engineering, and security. He works as a Lead Engineer in regulated environments, designing and operating Kubernetes-based platforms where reliability, compliance, and developer experience must coexist. His work focuses on architecture under real-world constraints, supply-chain security, and building systems that remain adaptable over time. Eduard regularly advises engineering leaders on technical strategy and decision-making at scale, bridging hands-on experience with long-term architectural thinking.

abstract:

Most systems are built under constraints: legacy code, regulation, organizational boundaries, and long-term accountability. This talk explores how Staff+ engineers and tech leads can make sound architectural decisions when “perfect” isn’t an option. Focusing on platforms and tooling, it presents practical ways to identify real constraints, preserve flexibility, avoid over-engineering, and communicate trade-offs that hold up over time - technically and organizationally.

full_description:

Modern systems rarely exist in ideal conditions. They grow over years, integrate with legacy services, operate under regulatory or security constraints, and are shaped by organizational boundaries just as much as by code. Yet architectural guidance often assumes greenfield projects and unlimited freedom.

This talk focuses on architectural decision-making under real-world constraints, using  systems as the primary lens. Rather than discussing specific frameworks or patterns, it presents a practical way of thinking about architecture when trade-offs are unavoidable and decisions must hold up over time.

Drawing from experience in regulated production environments, we will explore how to distinguish true constraints from accidental ones, how to think in terms of long-lived capabilities rather than short-lived components, and how to preserve optionality even when systems appear “locked in.” Examples will touch on Python-heavy platforms such as backend services, internal tools, data pipelines, and automation systems.

The session also addresses the human side of architecture: how Staff+ engineers and technical leaders communicate trade-offs, document decisions in a way that survives team changes, and align engineering, product, and compliance perspectives without over-engineering.

This talk is aimed at experienced engineers, tech leads, and engineering leaders who want to design systems that can evolve - even when constraints dominate the problem space.
