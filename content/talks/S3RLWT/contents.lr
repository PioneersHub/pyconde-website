abstract:

This session will give you a deep insight in how to easily create browser based applications with Marimo. You will learn how to implement a range of both reactive and interacitve elements speed up your development journey or daily business. Marimo itself was designed from scratch to be reactive and thus to overcome weaknesses of Jupyter, even with interactive extensions.

This session is especially interesting for:
+ data analysts
+ data engineers
+ data scientists
+ all Pythonista heavily using Jupyter notebooks

full_description:

I will start with a short comparison of Jupyter notebooks with Marimo to point out Marimo's strength to create interactive applications build on its reactive model. Daily routines will be processed both with Jupyter and Marimo, so that Marimo's improvements are standing out on their own. A technical deep dive will then explaing its principles and how they can be used for own projects. After this, a comprehensive presentatin will cover many Marimo features before a small project will be set up live to see how the Marimo approach can speed up many development steps.

### Batteries included
+ Marimo comes with a lot of input and output elements that can be implemented with a breeze. 
+ Its comprehensive documentation makes it easy to start with it from scratch or switching from Jupypter notebooks.
+ The code looks liks normal Python code and can directly be included in Git operations and workflows.
+ You could even use Marimo as an online IDE for working on your own computer e.g. for presentations.
