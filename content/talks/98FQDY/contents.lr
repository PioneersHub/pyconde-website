abstract: Defining what constitutes AI skills has always been ambiguous. As AI adoption accelerates across industries and the European AI Act mandates companies to ensure AI literacy among their staff, organizations face growing even more challenges in defining and developing AI competencies. In this talk, we'll present a comprehensive framework developed by the appliedAI Institute's experts that categorizes AI skills across technical, regulatory, strategic, and innovation domains. We'll also share initial data on current AI skills levels and upskilling needs and provide practical strategies for organizations to assess, develop, and acquire the AI capabilities required for their specific needs.
