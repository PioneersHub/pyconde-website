abstract: Python is one of the most versatile programming languages, but building complete applications—frontend, backend, and beyond—has often meant stepping outside Python into other tools and frameworks. **NiceGUI** changes this narrative. With just Python, NiceGUI enables developers to create traditional web apps, deploy machine learning models, and even control IoT devices, all in one streamlined workflow.

In this talk, we’ll explore the transformative power of NiceGUI, showing how it allows Python developers to move beyond scripts and build fully functional, production-ready applications with ease.
