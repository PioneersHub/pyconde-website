abstract:

Python is one of the most versatile programming languages, but building complete applications—frontend, backend, and beyond—has often meant stepping outside Python into other tools and frameworks. **NiceGUI** changes this narrative. With just Python, NiceGUI enables developers to create traditional web apps, deploy machine learning models, and even control IoT devices, all in one streamlined workflow.

In this talk, we’ll explore the transformative power of NiceGUI, showing how it allows Python developers to move beyond scripts and build fully functional, production-ready applications with ease.

full_description:

For years, Python developers have relied on external tools and frameworks to build applications that go beyond simple scripts. Frontend work often required learning HTML, CSS, or JavaScript, while deploying machine learning models or building IoT dashboards meant setting up additional layers of complexity. 

**NiceGUI** simplifies this process by providing a framework that combines Python with an intuitive approach to building applications.  It’s a framework that allows you to do everything—create user interfaces, manage backend logic, deploy machine learning models, and even handle IoT tasks—all within Python. Because this framework uniquely combines real-time interactivity, flexibility, and support for diverse applications like IoT, machine learning, and dynamic dashboards, it’s an easy pick over other alternatives.

While the possibilities with NiceGUI are extensive, this talk will focus on practical examples that demonstrate its potential. We’ll walk through:

- A chat application to showcase building interactive user interfaces,
- Editing and displaying data in a pandas DataFrame directly in the browser and
- Creating a to-do list for managing tasks with checkboxes and text inputs.

By the end of this session, you’ll see how NiceGUI empowers Python developers of all levels to build complete, functional applications without relying on external tools or languages.
