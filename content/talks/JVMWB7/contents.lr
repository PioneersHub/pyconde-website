abstract: As enterprises increasingly adopting Large Language Models (LLMs) for diverse AI applications, they encounter challenges in transitioning these solutions from proof-of-concept to production. Traditional MLOps workflows, designed primarily for conventional ML models, struggle to accommodate LLM-specific challenges such as managing embeddings, orchestrating sophisticated data ingestion pipelines, and deploying context-aware intelligent agents at scale. Compounding these difficulties is the requirement to integrate seamlessly with existing enterprise infrastructure, maintain reproducibility and traceability, and ensure optimal performance.

In this session, we share our hands-on experience to shed light on the pain points encountered while putting LLMs into production. Attendees will learn about bottlenecks from handling unstructured text data ingestion to scaling vector databases for efficient retrieval and discover how to address them with best tested strategies. We will also discuss the broader open source LLMOps landscape, revealing best practices for pipeline design, version control, model monitoring, and cross-functional collaboration. By sharing these lessons and insights, we aim to deliver our audience with practical knowledge that can be applied to their MLOps/LLMOps stack with any framework or tooling, so they can effectively leverage the power of LLMs for enterprise-scale applications.

description: Enterprises looking to operationalize LLMs often encounter numerous challenges that extend beyond those in traditional machine learning deployments, as standard MLOps practices cover areas like continuous integration, model monitoring, and automated deployment but may fall short when addressing the unique characteristics of LLMs, especially in embedding management, large-scale pipeline orchestration, and the dynamic behavior of intelligent, context-driven agents.

In this talk, we will explore how to efficiently manage large volumes of unstructured text data and maintain data quality in fast-paced environments, covering strategies for generating, storing, and updating document embeddings within vector databases to enable quick and context-aware retrieval, as well as methods for orchestrating and scaling pipeline components to ensure that every step from data preprocessing to model serving is reproducible and streamlined. We will also delve into considerations for deploying models and agents in real-world scenarios by addressing factors such as latency, context switching, and incorporating user feedback loops, while examining version control and compliance to maintain a clear audit trail for artifacts, models, and data changes, ensuring enterprise-grade governance and reproducibility.

Whether you're an AI engineer, a DevOps specialist, or a technical leader, you'll end-up learning practical tips and insights to handle the quickly changing world of LLMOps with this talk, no matter which tools or platforms you use.
