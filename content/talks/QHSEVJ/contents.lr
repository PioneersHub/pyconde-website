full_description:

As the number of production machine learning use-cases increase, we find ourselves facing new and bigger challenges where more is at stake. Because of this, it's critical to identify the key areas to focus our efforts, so we can ensure we're able to transition from machine learning models to reliable production machine learning systems that are robsut and scalable. In this talk Alejandro dives into the state of production machine learning in 2024, and covers the concepts that make production machine learning so challenging, as well as some of the recommended tools available to tackle these challenges.

We will be covering a deep dive of the production ML tooling ecosystem and dive into best practices that have been abstracted from production use-cases of machine learning operations at scale, as well as how to leverage tools to that will allow us to deploy, explain, secure, monitor and scale production machine learning systems.
