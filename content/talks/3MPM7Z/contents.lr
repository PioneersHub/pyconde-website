abstract: If you've ever wondered how your phone recognizes your face when you unlock it or how your photos app categorizes different objects, this talk will answer your questions. We’ll walk through the process of creating a simple image classifier using Python, breaking down the steps so you can understand and build your own. By the end, you’ll have a clear picture of how it all works—and the tools to try it yourself!

description: Have you ever wondered how your phone recognises faces or how apps can tell the difference between a cat and a dog? Behind the scenes, it’s all image classification! In this talk, you’ll learn how to build your own image classifier using Python—even if you’re completely new to machine learning.

We’ll break down the process into fun, easy-to-follow steps. You’ll discover how to:
1) Prepare and Preprocess Images: Learn how to feed images into your classifier.
2) Use Python Libraries: Explore tools like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or Keras to train your model.
3) Train a Simple Model: Create a basic classifier that can recognize different types of images.
4) Test and Improve Your Classifier: See how well your model performs and tweak it to get better results.

Get ready to see what’s _really_ in a picture—and teach your Python code to see it too!
