abstract: To apply or not to apply, that is the question.

Causal reasoning elevates predictive outcomes by shifting from *“what happened”* to *“what would happen ***if***”*. Yet, implementing causality can be challenging or even infeasible in some contexts. This talk explores how the very act of assessing its applicability can add value to your projects. Through a gentle introduction to causal inference tools and practical use cases, you will learn how to bring greater scientific rigour to real-world problems.

Target audience: Practicing and aspiring data scientists, machine learning engineers, and analysts looking to improve their decision-making with causal inference. 

No prior knowledge is assumed. 

For the seasoned practitioners I hope to shine light on aspects that may not have been considered. 💡
