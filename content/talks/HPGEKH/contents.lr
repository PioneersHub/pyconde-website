abstract: Many data and simulation scientists use NumPy for its ease of use and good performance on CPU.  This approach works well for single-node tasks, but scaling to handle larger datasets or more resource-intensive computations introduces significant challenges. Not to mention, using GPUs requires another level of complexity. We present the cuPyNumeric library, which  gives developers the same familiar NumPy interface, but seamlessly distributes work across CPUs and GPUs.
In this talk we showcase the productivity and performance of cuPyNumeric library on one of the user's examples covering some detail on its implementation.
