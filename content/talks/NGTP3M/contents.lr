abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enables enterprises to effectively use large language models with their own proprietary data. However, the rapid evolution of underlying technologies makes selecting and implementing suitable RAG solutions increasingly challenging.

In this talk, we share key insights from five real-world use cases, focusing on (1) building a modular, adaptable RAG system leveraging open-source libraries like LiteLLM and Langfuse, (2) ensuring consistent and scalable setups through Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC), and (3) applying systematic evaluation methods to enhance system quality. Attendees will leave with actionable strategies to design robust, GDPR-compliant RAG systems, integrate proprietary knowledge sources, and continuously optimize performance for scalable, future-proof applications.
