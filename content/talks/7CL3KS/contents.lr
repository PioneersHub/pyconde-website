abstract: SAP's data often remains locked away, hindering the creation of a complete data picture. This talk presents a hands-on proof of concept leveraging SAP Datasphere, Python and PySpark to bridge an Azure-based, data mesh-inspired open data lake with a centralized SAP BI environment. 

This presentation will delve into the architecture of SAP Datasphere and its integration interfaces with Python. It will explore network integration, authentication, authorization and resource management options, as well as data integration patterns. The presentation will summarize the evaluated features and limitations discovered during the PoC.
