abstract: Reinforcement Learning and related algorithms, such as Deep Q-Learning (DQL), have led to major breakthroughs in different fields. DQL, for example, is at the core of the AIs developed by DeepMind that achieved superhuman levels in such complex games as Chess, Shogi, and Go ("AlphaGo", "AlphaZero"). Reinforcement Learning can also be beneficially applied to typical problems in finance, such as algorithmic trading, dynamic hedging of options, or dynamic asset allocation. The workshop addresses the problem of limited data availability in finance and solutions to it, such as synthetic data generation through GANs. It also shows how to apply the DQL algorithm to typical financial problems. The workshop is based on my new O'Reilly book "Reinforcement Learning for Finance -- A Python-based Introduction".

The workshop covers the following topics:

* Learning through interaction
* Deep Q-Learning applied to Finance
* Synthetic Data Generation
* Dynamic Asset Allocation with DQL

The workshop is based on my new O'Reilly book "Reinforcement Learning for Finance -- A Python-based Introduction".
