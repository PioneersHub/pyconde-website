abstract:

[Polars](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars) is a fast, easy to use, and open source, dataframe library. It's clean API and its contexts and expressions allow writing readable but performant data wrangling code.

Aimed at both data newbies and experts from other libraries, in this hands-on tutorial we'll use data from the Pokémon franchise to explore the [Polars API](https://docs.pola.rs/api/python/stable/reference/index.html) and the ideas that set it apart from other dataframe libraries.

full_description:

This hands-on workshop will focus on teaching the fundamental concepts that differentiate Polars from the other dataframe libraries in use.

You will learn about expressions and contexts, and how they provide the modular building blocks that make the Polars API so intuitive. You will also learn about expression expansion, an often-overlooked feature that makes it much more convenient to write flexible expressions.

The lazy API is another key factor for the high performance we get from Polars and, in this tutorial, you will learn how to work with it.
This lets the Polars query engine optimise the data queries you write so that you can focus on expressing what you need to do to your data while Polars focuses on how to do it efficiently.
