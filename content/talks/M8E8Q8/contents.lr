abstract: [Polars](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars) is a fast, easy to use, and open source, dataframe library. It's clean API and its contexts and expressions allow writing readable but performant data wrangling code.

Aimed at both data newbies and experts from other libraries, in this hands-on tutorial we'll use data from the Pokémon franchise to explore the [Polars API](https://docs.pola.rs/api/python/stable/reference/index.html) and the ideas that set it apart from other dataframe libraries.
