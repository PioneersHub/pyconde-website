abstract:

Did you know a single ChatGPT query produces ~4.32g of CO₂? Now imagine the footprint of AI at scale. How many queries are equal to a London-to-Berlin flight? And how do factors like data center choice or advanced techniques like Chain of Thought (CoT) and Reasoning multiply these effects? Join me to uncover the true environmental cost of AI, explore solutions like 1-Bit Quantization, and learn how to make innovation sustainable.

full_description:

Did you know a single ChatGPT query equals to ~4.32g of CO₂? While this might seem small, the environmental footprint of AI scales rapidly when multiplied by billions of daily interactions worldwide. But what does this mean in real-world terms? How many AI queries are equivalent to a flight from London to Berlin? And how do factors like data center selection or advanced techniques like Chain of Thought (CoT) and Reasoning amplify the impact even further?

In this talk, we’ll demystify the environmental costs of artificial intelligence and shed light on the resources that power its development and usage. We’ll explore how energy, water, and hardware demands play a pivotal role in running data centers and how decisions like model design and deployment location can affect the sustainability of AI. With detailed calculations, real-world comparisons, and actionable insights, this session will equip attendees with the knowledge to innovate responsibly and sustainably.
