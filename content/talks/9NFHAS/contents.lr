abstract: The Transformer architecture, originally designed for machine translation, has revolutionized deep learning with applications in natural language processing, computer vision, and time series forecasting. Recently, its capabilities have extended to sequence-to-sequence tasks involving log data, such as telemetric event data from computer games.

This talk demonstrates how to apply a Transformer-based model to game log data, showcasing its potential for sequence prediction and representation learning. Attendees will gain insights into implementing a simple Transformer in Python, optimizing it through hyperparameter tuning, architectural adjustments, and defining an appropriate vocabulary for game logs.

Real-world applications, including clustering and user level predictions, will be explored using a dataset of over 175 million events from an MMORPG. The talk will conclude with a discussion of the model's performance, computational requirements, and future opportunities for this approach.
