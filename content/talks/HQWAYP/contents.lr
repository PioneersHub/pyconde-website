abstract: Do you need to compare sets of points in a plane? Identify a potential cyclic event in high-dimensional time series data? Find the second or the third highest peak of a noisily sampled function? Topological data analysis (TDA) is not a universal hammer, but it might just be the 16 mm wrench for your 16 mm hex head bolt. There is no shortage of Python libraries implementing TDA methods for various settings, but navigating the options can be challanging without prior familiarity with the topic. In my talk I will demonstrate the utility of the tool with several simple examples, list various libraries used by the TDA community, and dive a bit deeper into the methods to explain what the libraries implement and how to interpret and work with the outputs.
