abstract: Digitalizing paper documents to structured data is a common challenge in not only data analysis but also business activities, especially when the volume of documents is large or when one encounters documents with diverse formats. In this proposal, we will share insights from our use case of menu digitalization, where we leverage Google DocumentAI to extract key information such as names, prices, and descriptions from menus. Following this, we enhance the digitalized content, including grouping extracted items, using Gemini. This approach streamlines the menu digitalization process, enabling automation that delivers efficient and accurate outputs for end users. 

We will explore the technical implementation of this workflow, the challenges we faced, and how we addressed them using Python-based tools and frameworks. We hope to provide audiences practical knowledge about applying similar techniques to their own document-processing needs, building up end-to-end solutions. This talk aims to provide valuable insights into integrating AI-powered tools to solve real-world business challenges effectively.

description: Digitalizing paper documents is a common challenge in both data analysis and business operations. In this session, we will dive deep into a real-world use case of menu digitalization, where we encounter files with large volumes and diverse formats. These features lead to significantly increased complexity, especially when we aim at returning structured data, if we use traditional text extraction methods. We present an end-to-end solution that is not only suitable for batch process, but also for individual usage from end users. 

In our solution, we leverage Google DocumentAI to extract critical information from menus, including menu item names, prices, volumes, descriptions and allergy info. The response from DocumentAI can be easily transferred into relational data. Beyond extraction, we employ Gemini to enhance the digitalized content by grouping the extracted data. This enables us to gain valuable info beyond menu itself for seamless usability. 

The session will provide a step-by-step walkthrough of the entire workflow, highlighting how Python-based tools and frameworks power the implementation. We will discuss: 
1. How to set up and use Google DocumentAI for document data extraction. 
2. Techniques to clean, structure, and validate the extracted data for accuracy and usability. 
3. How Gemini contributes to grouping and enhancing the digitalized content, making it ready for applications such as POS (Point of Sale) onboarding. 

We will also share the challenges faced during the process, such as handling inconsistent document formats and ensuring reliable outputs, along with the strategies we used to overcome them. The talk will include practical demonstrations of key Python libraries and tools used to build this end-to-end solution, ensuring attendees gain actionable knowledge to tackle their own document-processing challenges. 
By the end of this session, we hope that attendees will: 
1. Understand how to integrate AI-powered document processing tools into their workflows. 
2. Gain insights into building scalable, automated pipelines for efficient and accurate data extraction and enhancement.
