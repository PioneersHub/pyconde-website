abstract: Digitalizing paper documents to structured data is a common challenge in not only data analysis but also business activities, especially when the volume of documents is large or when one encounters documents with diverse formats. In this proposal, we will share insights from our use case of menu digitalization, where we leverage Google DocumentAI to extract key information such as names, prices, and descriptions from menus. Following this, we enhance the digitalized content, including grouping extracted items, using Gemini. This approach streamlines the menu digitalization process, enabling automation that delivers efficient and accurate outputs for end users. 

We will explore the technical implementation of this workflow, the challenges we faced, and how we addressed them using Python-based tools and frameworks. We hope to provide audiences practical knowledge about applying similar techniques to their own document-processing needs, building up end-to-end solutions. This talk aims to provide valuable insights into integrating AI-powered tools to solve real-world business challenges effectively.
