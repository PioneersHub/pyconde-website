abstract:

Ever wanted to compute a range join in Pandas but find the current implementation memory expensive and generally inefficient? Well, look no more. This talk will show you how to compute range joins in a performant manner in Pandas.

full_description:

Imagine a manufacturer wishing to minimise the cost of storage while maximising profits (increasing the inventory of the more profitable product, while decreasing the storage for the less profitable product), or a tax audit to find out which employers earn more, but pay less tax. It could be as simple as efficiently finding the range of dates that dates from another dataframe fit into. These are problems that can be solved by range joins. At the moment, the way to solve this in Pandas is with a cartesian join, which can be expensive memory wise, and generally is inefficient. This talk aims to show a better, more efficient way of solving range joins with Pandas.

The talk will contain a description of the algorithms implemented, as well as some speed tests with regards to performance.
