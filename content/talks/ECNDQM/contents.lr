abstract: Linear Regression is the workhorse of statistics and data science. Some data scientists even go as far and argue that "linear regression is all you need". 

In this talk, we will introduce three ways to run regression models faster by using smarter algorithms, implemented in the scikit-learn & fastreg (sparse solvers), pyfixest (Frisch-Waugh-Lovell), and duckreg (regression compression via duckdb) libraries.
