full_description:

In this presentation, I will introduce an innovative data pipeline built with PySpark and powered by large language models (LLMs) to transform the way skills are classified from resumes. By combining advanced NLP and machine learning techniques, the system tackles a multi-class, multi-topic classification challenge, aligning extracted skills with a standardized classification framework. Additionally, the AI-driven algorithm evaluates the significance of each skill for specific profiles, enhancing precision and relevance. A working prototype is already accessible at www.job-me.it, showcasing the potential of this cutting-edge approach.
