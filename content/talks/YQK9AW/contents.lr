abstract: This is another talk from the continuing series of "What does it actually take to make ...".

This time we're covering what it takes to display data streams in a web based environment in order to have an overview of the current state of a system or track its behaviour over time.

This is a central component in smart home systems such as Home Assistant, or in monitoring environments for example built on top of influx and grafana.

If you're interested in how these things basically work, then you're in luck these days, as many solutions in this area are open source, and you just can take a look at the sources. But let's be honest, this isn't entirely true given a code base of many million lines of code in some cases. 

Well you might be able to go back to version 0.0.1 ...

On the other hand there might as well be a talk to cover the basic concepts of what it takes to make a version 0.0.x for such a thing.

And this is the talk ;-)
