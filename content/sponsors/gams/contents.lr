full_description: GAMS (General Algebraic Modeling System) develops software for building and solving mathematical optimization models. For more than 35 years, researchers, engineers, and decision-makers in academia and industry have used GAMS to formulate complex problems in energy, economics, logistics, and engineering in a transparent and solver-agnostic way. GAMS provides a high-level modeling language, seamless access to a broad ecosystem of state-of-the-art solvers, and scalable execution from laptops to cloud infrastructure. With GAMSPy, GAMS brings optimization modeling directly into the Python ecosystem. GAMSPy allows users to define large-scale optimization models using familiar Python syntax while retaining the performance and rigor of mature optimization technology. By combining Python’s flexibility with proven mathematical optimization, GAMS helps bridge the gap between data science, research, and real-world decision support.
