full_description: PyLadies is an international mentorship group with a focus on helping more women become active participants and leaders in the Python open-source community. Our mission is to promote, educate and advance a diverse Python community through outreach, education, conferences, events and social gatherings. PyLadies also aims to provide a friendly support network for women and a bridge to the larger Python world. Anyone with an interest in Python is encouraged to participate! PyLadies Südwest meet regularly. There is usually a talk and a hands-on session over a Python topic and sometimes we do a book club meeting. Anyone is welcome to propose topics that wishes to learn and give a talk.
