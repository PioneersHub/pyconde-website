### Standing Together: PyLadies at PyCon PyData DE 2025

At a time when progress toward equity in tech seems precarious, community-driven initiatives like PyLadies become not just valuable but essential. As we prepare for PyCon PyData DE 2025, we invite you to join us in celebrating and supporting the vital work that PyLadies continues to do in creating pathways for underrepresented groups in the Python ecosystem.

### A Critical Moment for Community Action

"We stand on precarious ground, facing a critical juncture. If we do not remain vigilant, the progress we have achieved could easily backslide into oppression" (PyLadies Berlin, 2024). These words from PyLadies Berlin underscore why our presence at major conferences like PyCon PyData DE matters now more than ever. When organizations dedicated to equity are being disbanded and narratives around inclusion are shifting, visible community spaces become crucial gathering points for resistance, networking, and continued advocacy.

### PyLadies at PyCon PyData DE 2025: Where to Find Us

#### PyLadies will have a dedicated area in the conference lobby at the main floor, look for the ancient walls. 

This year, through the unwavering support of the conference organizers and the Python Software Verband, PyLadies will maintain a significant presence with multiple activities designed to foster learning, connection, and community building.
* Tuesday, 22 April - HumbleData Workshop: An accessible data science introduction designed for beginners from underrepresented groups
* Tuesday, 22 April - Django Girls Workshop: Hands-on web development training in a supportive environment
* Thursday 14:20 in Zeiss Plenary - PyLadies Panel: Thought leaders candidly addressing gender equity in tech and Python communities
* PyLadies Lunch: A dedicated space for community building and informal mentoring
* PyLadies Booth: A safe warm space that serves as a meeting and chilling point

### The Power of Consistent Allyship

We extend our profound gratitude to the PyCon PyData DE organizing team and the Python Software Verband, who have demonstrated what genuine allyship looks like through years of consistent support. Rather than engaging in what could be described as "diversity-washing practices that boil down to quick, superficial gestures" (PyLadies Berlin, 2024), the conference has created substantive opportunities for marginalized voices to be heard, supported, and amplified.
This partnership exemplifies how technical communities can work together toward a more equitable future—not through tokenism or expectation of free labor, but through material support that respects our community's expertise and time.

### Volunteer-Driven Impact: Not to Be Taken for Granted

It's essential to recognize that every PyLadies activities—from workshops to panels to community spaces—is orchestrated entirely by volunteers who balance this work with their own careers and personal responsibilities. These individuals contribute their time and expertise not for recognition or compensation, but out of commitment to gender equity and diversity.
As the text shared by PyLadies Berlin reminds us: "PyLadies volunteers offer coding tutorials, career guidance, and moral support to people who face discrimination in hiring or bias within workplaces" (2024). This work continues largely unseen, creating pathways and opportunities that transform individual lives and gradually reshape our technical communities.

### A Call to Action: Show Up and Stand With Us

The presence of community-based groups like PyLadies at major technical conferences isn't merely symbolic—it's transformative. It creates physical and intellectual spaces where underrepresented individuals can find belonging, build networks, and access opportunities that might otherwise remain out of reach.
We call on our community members and allies to show up in tangible ways:
Attend PyLadies events at the conference
Visit our booth to learn how you can support our initiatives
Amplify the voices and work of community members from marginalized backgrounds
Consider how you might contribute resources, mentorship, or advocacy beyond the conference
As we navigate what PyLadies Berlin describes as a "troubling shift in narratives surrounding DEIB (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging)" (2024), your active participation becomes an act of resistance and hope.
