The community voting for the PyCon DE and PyData conference is open now.
It is important for us to see what the community wants to see at the conference.
Voting will run for ten days from

ðŸ“… **Thu, 9 January, 12:00:00 (CET)**

until

ðŸ“… **Sun, 19 January, 24:00 (CET)**

### Guiding principles

- Open to the community
- Give the community a voice in shaping the conference programme
- Unbiased: speakers' names will not be displayed on the voting page
- Submissions will be displayed in random order for each participant
- Robust against fraud, as no new identities can be set up for voting purposes
- Crowdsource work to reduce the burden on organizers who contribute their free time
- Easy participation without creating new online accounts

### Who can participate?

In order to vote, you need an email address known to us, i.e., has been used for the following

- Participation in one of the past conferences PyCon DE & PyData Berlin 2019, 2022 or 2023, PyCon DE 2017 or 2018
- Submitted a talk for 2019, 2022, 2023, 2024 or 2025

### How to access the voting page.

- Go to [the community voting page](https://pretalx.com/pyconde-pydata-2025/p/voting/signup/).
- Enter a qualified email address (see: "Who can participate" above)
- The system will now check whether this email address is known. If it is, the system will email you with a magic link
- Check your inbox (and spam) for the email with the magic link


#### You don't remember which e-mail address was used?

- Try the email addresses that might be in questionâ€”the site will give you feedback immediately.
- If you no longer have access to an email address that was used for the conference in the past (e.g., the address of a
  previous employer), please understand that we cannot add or change individual email addresses.

You should automatically stay logged in, otherwise please use the link from the email again or let the system send you a
new magic link by re-entering your email address.

Please note that it may take a few minutes before you receive the email. It is sent immediately, but the mail providers
seem to hold it back a bit.

### How does the voting system work?

- Through voting we want to better understand what the community is interested in seeing.
- The voting system only allows positive votes, i.e., there is no way to downgrade proposals by giving them a bad
  rating.
- The system saves your previous votes, and you can change them at any time until the end of voting.
- The vote is automatically saved upon selection.

You can vote:

- Must see
- Would like to see
- Not interested / Indifferent

Based on this, we determine the preferences of the community.

**Disclaimer**: please note that proposals are published the way these were submitted by the authors (program committee
didnâ€™t edit them). If you encounter some typos or formatting mistakes, please ignore them.

In case a proposal is **offensive** or **violates** our [Code of Conduct](https://2025.pycon.de/code-of-conduct/),
please report this issue to us: [program25@pycon.de](mailto:program25@pycon.de).

### Selection of Submissions

Voting has a big influence on the selection, although the final selection is up to the programme committee.

We believe that a good conference consists of popular talks as well as new or niche topicsâ€”all by and for our diverse
community.
