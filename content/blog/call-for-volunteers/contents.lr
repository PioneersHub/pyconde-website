### Volunteer Selection Process
Our conference is community-driven and strongly committed to fostering an inclusive and diverse environment. We believe in the value of a diverse team and are particularly interested in ensuring that underrepresented minorities (URM) have a voice and an active role in shaping our event. This philosophy extends to our volunteer selection process, where we aim to build a team that reflects a wide range of backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives.

##### Application Form
We ask applicants to provide basic information such as their email address, full name, and country of residence. We also inquire about whether they’ve volunteered with us in the past to build on prior experience and foster long-term community engagement. 

[Apply now by filling out this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1LMgL23rYTqQ6FAc5yvG1F9pqdEBbXoice0PcWTtv9mI).

##### Personal Background and Motivation
In addition to collecting factual details, we also ask each applicant to tell us a bit about themselves and their background. This helps us understand the unique perspectives they bring to the conference. We encourage applicants to share what motivates them to volunteer and how they’d like to contribute. This information is crucial as it helps us gauge not only their enthusiasm but also how they envision supporting the event.

##### Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion
Our community places a high value on diversity and inclusion. In line with this, we are particularly keen to hear from individuals from underrepresented groups and those who can offer different perspectives. While we do not require extensive experience, we prioritize applicants who share our commitment to creating a welcoming and supportive environment for all participants.

##### Meeting Availability
One day before the conference, we organize an in-person meeting with all volunteers at the venue. This meeting is essential for familiarizing volunteers with the layout of the venue, reviewing tasks, and building team cohesion. We ask volunteers to confirm their availability for this meeting to ensure that they can fully engage in the preparation process.


##### Final Selection and Notification
Once we review all applications, we will select a diverse group of volunteers based on their background, motivation, and availability. Selected volunteers will be notified via email, and detailed information about their roles and tasks will be provided.
