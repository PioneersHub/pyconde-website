> The Space is unlimited. Our space, unfortunately, isn’t.


The interest in our 90-minute tutorials is huge – and while space may be infinite, our rooms sadly aren’t.

Our 90-minute tutorials are a highlight of the conference—and in high demand. This year, we’re offering:

* 130 seats in Room Dynamicum
* 260 seats in Room Ferrum

To help you secure your spot and make the most of your time, please read the following guidelines.

#### Reserving a Spot

To attend a tutorial, you’ll need to reserve a seat at the registration desk. Just drop by and ask—our team will help you.


#### Wristbands: Your Tutorial Access

You’ll receive a wristband when you reserve a tutorial seat. Please note:

* **Wristbands are required** to enter a tutorial room.
* Each wristband is valid for one specific tutorial only.
* You can collect wristbands for the **current or next day** at the registration desk.
* Up to three wristbands can be collected per participant.
* **Arrive 10–15 minutes before the tutorial starts**.
* **Five minutes before the tutorial, unclaimed seats will be given away—wristband or not**.
* Wristbands are not personalized—feel free to swap or return them at the registration desk if you change your plans.

#### In the Tutorial Room

Tutorials are popular and rooms will be full. To help everything run smoothly:

* Arrive early—at least 10 minutes before the tutorial begins.
* Take a seat promptly and avoid blocking aisles or sitting on the floor—venue rules require all attendees to be seated on chairs.
* Power sockets are available—please be considerate and share access.
* After the tutorial, everyone must leave the room, even if you’re attending another one right after.
* Want to keep chatting with instructors or other attendees? Please continue the conversation outside the room.

#### ⚠️ Important: Wristband Seats Expire!

**If you’re not seated at least 5 minutes before the tutorial starts, your spot may be given away.**
Even with a wristband, arriving late means you may not get in. If that happens, please exit quietly to respect others’ experience.
