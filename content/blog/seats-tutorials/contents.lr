* Wristbands will be available at the registration desk.
* Tutorial wristbands can be collected for the same day or the following day.
* Wristband wearers must enter the tutorial room 10-15 minutes before the start of the tutorial. Five minutes before the start of the tutorial, any remaining seats will be made available to anyone.
* Wristbands are not personalized. Feel free to exchange and swap tutorial wristbands with other conference participants. 
You can also return them at the registration desk. 

### Attending tutorials

It is expected that the tutorials will be crowded. Therefore, please keep following rules:

* Please be in the tutorial room 10-15 minutes before the tutorial starts.
* Please make yourself comfortable at your seat so that others can do the same. 
* Please remember that everyone must sit on a chair. According to the venue's house rules, no one can stand in the room or sit on the floor.
* There are power sockets in each tutorial room, please be mindful and share the charging capacity with others in the room.
* At the end of the tutorial, everyone must leave the room, even if you have a wristband for the next tutorial. Please leave the room in an orderly and effecient manner. 
* If you’d like to continue conversation with the instructor(s) or other attendees, please move the conversation to the area outside the tutorial rooms. 

### Warning!!! Seats have expired 5 min before the tutorial starts.

Seats not taken five minutes before the tutorial will be considered available to anyone. 
If you arrive with a tutorial wristband five minutes or less before the tutorial starts and can’t get a seat, then you won't be able to participate. 
We ask that you leave the room quietly with respect for those who have arrived on time and followed these guidelines.
