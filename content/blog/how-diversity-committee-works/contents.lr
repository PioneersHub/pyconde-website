Every year, PyCon DE & PyData brings together people from many backgrounds, cultures, and communities. Some arrive with long histories in
open source, others attend their very first international tech event. And while the conference experience is full of visible moments —
talks, workshops, hallway conversations — one essential part of the event happens quietly, long before anyone arrives in Darmstadt.

That work is carried out by the **Diversity Committee**: a small group of volunteers dedicated to ensuring that financial and structural
barriers don’t prevent motivated, talented individuals from joining the conference. Their decisions influence who gets to be in the room,
whose perspectives are included, and how accessible the conference becomes each year.

Here’s a look behind the scenes at how this committee operates.

#### **💛 A Mission Focused on Access and Inclusion**

The Diversity Committee’s purpose is to support people who would benefit from attending the conference — and who would contribute to the
community — but who might not have the means to participate otherwise.

Financial Aid helps applicants experiencing financial hardship, people from underrepresented and systemically oppressed groups, students,
job seekers, and participants coming from regions where attending an international event would be difficult.  
The core belief is simple:  
**A more diverse group of attendees makes the entire conference richer, more representative, and more vibrant.**

#### **🧭 When the Work Begins**

The committee begins its work **well in advance of the conference** because preparing a fair review cycle, handling communication, and
supporting visa processes for international applicants all require significant time.

Early in the cycle, the committee:

* reviews the previous year’s programme and outcomes
* defines priorities and values for the upcoming cycle
* updates the application form
* sets the internal workflow and review timeline

Once applications open, the committee moves into its most intensive period of evaluation.

#### **📝 How Applications Are Reviewed**

To make the process equitable and thoughtful, the committee follows a structured, multi-step review system.

##### **1\) Independent evaluation**

Each application is reviewed by several committee members.  
Reviewers do not see each other’s scores until all assessments are complete, reducing bias.

##### **2\) Motivation matters**

A strong motivation statement is crucial.  
The committee looks for applicants who not only want to learn but also plan to bring value back to their communities — through open-source
work, meetups, education, mentoring, or organizing initiatives locally.

##### **3\) Understanding context**

Economic circumstances, geographic and social background, visa barriers, and access to similar opportunities help the committee understand
each applicant’s situation.

##### **4\) Supporting underrepresented groups**

Applicants may self-identify as part of an underrepresented group, and this information is considered sensitively and without imposing
definitions.

##### **5\) Prioritising first-time attendees**

When resources are limited, preference often goes to applicants who have not received financial aid in the past or who are attending PyCon
DE for the first time.

#### **🛂 Support Beyond Selection**

Once decisions are made, the committee remains closely involved, helping grantees prepare for their trip. This includes:

* providing invitation letters for visa applications
* coordinating with the organising team regarding hotel arrangements
* answering questions about logistics and next steps
* guiding participants through reimbursement after the conference

This ongoing support ensures that grantees feel informed, welcomed, and confident throughout the process.

#### **👥 Who Is on the Diversity Committee?**

The committee is typically composed of four to five volunteers who meet regularly throughout the year.  
Members bring a mix of experience from event organisation, community work, open-source contributions, and diversity and inclusion
initiatives.

New volunteers are invited once a year — usually around **October–November**, in alignment with the general volunteer call for PyCon DE.  
When selecting new members, the committee also takes diversity within the team into account to avoid replicating the same structural biases
it aims to address.

#### **🌱 Why This Work Matters**

A diverse group of participants benefits the entire conference:

* conversations become richer
* perspectives broaden
* communities gain new connections
* underrepresented groups have more visibility in tech spaces
* By removing financial and structural barriers, the Diversity Committee helps ensure that PyCon DE & PyData remains open, inclusive, and
  globally representative.

#### **💬 In Summary**

Much of the work of the Diversity Committee happens quietly, but its impact is far-reaching.  
Through careful evaluation, thoughtful selection, and continuous support, the committee helps build a conference where more people — from
more backgrounds — can participate fully.

We look forward to welcoming this year’s grant recipients and continuing to strengthen our community through inclusivity.
