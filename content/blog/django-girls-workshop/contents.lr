### What is Django Girls?

Django Girls is a global initiative that empowers women to learn programming in a fun, welcoming, and supportive environment. During the workshop, participants will build their first web application using Python and Django—no prior coding experience needed!

Our amazing mentors will guide small groups through the learning process, ensuring that everyone feels encouraged and supported. The goal? To show that coding is for everyone and to inspire more women to explore software development!

### Workshop Details

If you are a woman, know English and have a laptop, you can apply for our event! You don't need to know any technical stuff – our workshop is for people who are new to programming.

As a workshop attendee you will:
- attend a one-day Django workshop during which you will create your first website
- be fed by us: during our event, food is provided. Thanks to PyConDE, snacks and lunch will be served during the workshop.

You’ll get hands-on experience with Django and Python, meet inspiring people, and take your first steps in web development—all for free! No prior programming knowledge is required.

### FAQs

**Do I need to know anything about websites or programming?**

No! Workshops are for beginners. You don’t need to know anything about it. However, if you have a little bit of technical knowledge (i.e. you know what HTML or CSS are) you still can apply!

**Do I need to have something installed on my laptop?**

It would be helpful to have Django installed before workshops, but wouldn't expect you to install anything on your own. We will make sure that one of our coaches will help you out with this task.

**I do not speak German well, can I attend?**

Of course! Workshops will be in English, so if you have no troubles with speaking and understanding English - you should apply. 

**Should I bring my own laptop?**

Yes. We have no hardware, so we expect you to bring your computer with you. It is also important for us that you will take home everything you’ll write and create during workshops.
