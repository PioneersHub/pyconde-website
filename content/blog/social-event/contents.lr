After soaking up all that knowledge during the talks and the Lightning Talks, 
what better way to unwind than connecting with Python fellows at our Social Event?

* When? Thursday evening, April 24th, kicking off right after the Lightning Talks finish, running from 19:00 to 22:00 (7 PM - 10 PM). 🗓️⏰
* Where? It's happening right here at the Darmstadtium.
* What? We'll have a selection of drinks available – think beer 🍺, wine 🍷, and plenty of non-alcoholic options 🥤. Plus, tasty finger food 🍢 

Just like previous years, a separate ticket is required to join the Social Event. 

Mark your calendars and get ready for an evening of fun, conversation, and community!
